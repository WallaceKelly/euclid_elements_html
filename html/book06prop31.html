      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">In right</span>-<span class="perseus-emph">angled triangles the figure on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be a right-angled triangle having the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> right; I say that the figure on <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> be drawn perpendicular. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then since, in the right-angled triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> has been drawn from the right angle at <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> perpendicular to the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, the triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> and to one another. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop08">VI. 8</a>] 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is similar to <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>, therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06def01">VI. Def. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since three straight lines are proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first to the similar and similarly described figure on the second. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop19">VI. 19, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, so is the figure on <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> to the similar and similarly described figure on <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason also, as <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, so is the figure on <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> to that on <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span>; so that, in addition, as <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>, so is the figure on <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> to the similar and similarly described figures on <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>; therefore the figure on <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is also equal to the similar and similarly described figures on <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
