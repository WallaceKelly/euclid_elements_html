       <span class="perseus-ital">Planes to which the same straight line is at right angles will be parallel.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let any straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be at right angles to each of the planes <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>; I say that the planes are parallel. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if not, they will meet when produced. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let them meet; they will then make, as common section, a straight line. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop03">XI. 3</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let them make <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>; let a point <span class="perseus-ital">K</span> be taken at random on <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BK</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is at right angles to the plane <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is also at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">BK</span> which is a straight line in the plane <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> produced; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11def03">XI. Def. 3</a>] therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">ABK</span> is right. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason the angle <span class="perseus-ital">BAK</span> is also right. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Thus, in the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABK</span>, the two angles <span class="perseus-ital">ABK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BAK</span> are equal to two right angles: which is impossible. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop17">I. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the planes <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> will not meet when produced; therefore the planes <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> are parallel. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11def08">XI. Def. 8</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore planes to which the same straight line is at right angles are parallel. Q. E. D.</p>
