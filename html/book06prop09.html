      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be the given straight line; thus it is required to cut off from <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> a prescribed part. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">Let a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> be drawn through from <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> containing with <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> any angle; let a point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> be taken at random on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>.
