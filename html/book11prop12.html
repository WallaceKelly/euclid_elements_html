       <span class="perseus-ital">To set up a straight line at right angles to a given plane from a given point in it.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the plane of reference be the given plane, and <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> the point in it; thus it is required to set up from the point <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> a straight line at right angles to the plane of reference. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let any elevated point <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be conceived, from <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> let <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> be drawn perpendicular to the plane of reference, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop11">XI. 11</a>] and through the point <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> let <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> be drawn parallel to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop31">I. 31</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are two parallel straight lines, while one of them, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, is at right angles to the plane of reference, therefore the remaining one, <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, is also at right angles to the plane of reference. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop08">XI. 8</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> has been set up at right angles to the given plane from the point <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> in it.</p>
