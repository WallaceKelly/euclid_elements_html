       <span class="perseus-ital">In equal cones and cylinders the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; and those cones and cylinders in which the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights are equal.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be equal cones and cylinders of which the circles <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span> are the bases; let <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> be the diameters of the bases, and <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> the axes, which are also the heights of the cones or cylinders; let the cylinders <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span> be completed. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that in the cylinders <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so is the height <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> to the height <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the height <span class="perseus-ital">LK</span> is either equal to the height <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> or not equal. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">First, let it be equal. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span> is also equal to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But cones and cylinders which are of the same height are to one another as their bases; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop11">XII. 11</a>] therefore the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is also equal to the base <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Hence also, reciprocally, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so is the height <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> to the height <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, let the height <span class="perseus-ital">LK</span> not be equal to <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, but let <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> be greater; from the height <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> let <span class="perseus-ital">QN</span> be cut off equal to <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, through the point <span class="perseus-ital">Q</span> let the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span> be cut by the plane <span class="perseus-ital">TUS</span> parallel to the planes of the circles <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">RP</span>, and let the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">ES</span> be conceived erected from the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span> as base and with height <span class="perseus-ital">NQ</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span> is equal to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span>, therefore, as the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span> is to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">ES</span>, so is the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span> to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">ES</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop07">V. 7</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span> is to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">ES</span>, so is the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> to the base <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, for the cylinders <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ES</span> are of the same height; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop11">XII. 11</a>] and, as the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span> is to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">ES</span>, so is the height <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> to the height <span class="perseus-ital">QN</span>, for the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span> has been cut by a plane which is parallel to its opposite planes. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop13">XII. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so is the height <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> to the height <span class="perseus-ital">QN</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the height <span class="perseus-ital">QN</span> is equal to the height <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>; therefore, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so is the height <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> to the height <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore in the cylinders <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, in the cylinders <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span> let the bases be reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so let the height <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> be to the height <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>; I say that the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span> is equal to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, with the same construction, since, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so is the height <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> to the height <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, while the height <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span> is equal to the height <span class="perseus-ital">QN</span>, therefore, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so is the height <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> to the height <span class="perseus-ital">QN</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so is the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span> to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">ES</span>, for they are of the same height; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop11">XII. 11</a>] and, as the height <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">QN</span>, so is the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span> to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">ES</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop13">XII. 13</a>] therefore, as the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span> is to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">ES</span>, so is the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span> to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">ES</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span> is equal to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EP</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop09">V. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the same is true for the cones also. Q. E. D.</p>
