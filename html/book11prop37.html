      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> be four straight lines in proportion, so that, as <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>; and let there be described on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> the similar and similarly situated parallelepipedal solids <span class="perseus-ital">KA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">LC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ME</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NG</span>; I say that, as <span class="perseus-ital">KA</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">LC</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">ME</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">NG</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the parallelepipedal solid <span class="perseus-ital">KA</span> is similar to <span class="perseus-ital">LC</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">KA</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">LC</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason <span class="perseus-ital">ME</span> also has to <span class="perseus-ital">NG</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>. [<span class="perseus-ital">id</span>.] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, as <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">LC</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">ME</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">NG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, as the solid <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span> is to the solid <span class="perseus-ital">LC</span>, so let the solid <span class="perseus-ital">ME</span> be to the solid <span class="perseus-ital">NG</span>; I say that, as the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For since, again, <span class="perseus-ital">KA</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">LC</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop33">XI. 33</a>] and <span class="perseus-ital">ME</span> also has to <span class="perseus-ital">NG</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>, [<span class="perseus-ital">id</span>.] and, as <span class="perseus-ital">KA</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">LC</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">ME</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">NG</span>, therefore also, as <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>. </p>
