      <p class="perseus-p">Let the parallelograms <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span> be completed. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then since, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, while <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>, therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore in the parallelograms <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">Next, let the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> be equal to the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>; I say that the four straight lines will be proportional, so that, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, with the same construction, since the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, and the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> is <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, for <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, and the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> is <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span>, for <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And they are equiangular </p>
