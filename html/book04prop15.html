      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">In a given circle to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular hexagon</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDEF</span> be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular hexagon in the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDEF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the diameter <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDEF</span> be drawn; let the centre <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> of the circle be taken, and with centre <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> and distance <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> let the circle <span class="perseus-emph">EGCH</span> be described;  let <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span> be joined and carried through to the points <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that the hexagon <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDEF</span> is equilateral and equiangular. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the point <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> is the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDEF</span>, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">GE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span>.</div>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since the point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> is the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">GCH</span>, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">GE</span> was proved equal to <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">GE</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>; therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">EGD</span> is equilateral;</div> and therefore its three angles <span class="perseus-emph">EGD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GDE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DEG</span> are equal to one another, inasmuch as, in isosceles triangles, the angles at the base are equal to one another. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop05">I. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the three angles of the triangle are equal to two right angles; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop32">I. 32</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EGD</span> is one-third of two right angles.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DGC</span> can also be proved to be onethird of two right angles. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span> standing on <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> makes the adjacent angles <span class="perseus-emph">EGC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CGB</span> equal to two right angles, therefore the remaining angle <span class="perseus-emph">CGB</span> is also one-third of two right angles. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the angles <span class="perseus-emph">EGD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DGC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CGB</span> are equal to one another; so that the angles vertical to them, the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BGA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AGF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FGE</span> are equal. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop15">I. 15</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the six angles <span class="perseus-emph">EGD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DGC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CGB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BGA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AGF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FGE</span> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But equal angles stand on equal circumferences; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop26">III. 26</a>] therefore the six circumferences <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop29">III. 29</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore the six straight lines are equal to one another; therefore the hexagon <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDEF</span> is equilateral.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that it is also equiangular. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> is equal to the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, <div class="perseus-center">let the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> be added to each; therefore the whole <span class="perseus-emph">FABCD</span> is equal to the whole <span class="perseus-emph">EDCBA</span>;</div>
       and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FED</span> stands on the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">FABCD</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AFE</span> on the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">EDCBA</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AFE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop27">III. 27</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly it can be proved that the remaining angles of the hexagon <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDEF</span> are also severally equal to each of the angles <span class="perseus-emph">AFE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FED</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the hexagon <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDEF</span> is equiangular.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it was also proved equilateral; and it has been inscribed in the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDEF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore in the given circle an equilateral and equiangular hexagon has been inscribed. Q. E. F. </p>
      <div class="perseus-porism" org="uniform" sample="complete">
       
       <p class="perseus-p">From this it is manifest that the side of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the circle. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">And, in like manner as in the case of the pentagon, if through the points of division on the circle we draw tangents to the circle, there will be circumscribed about the circle an equilateral and equiangular hexagon in conformity with what was explained in the case of the pentagon. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">And further by means similar to those explained in the case of the pentagon we can both inscribe a circle in a given hexagon and circumscribe one about it. Q. E. F.</p>
