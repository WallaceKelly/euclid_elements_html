      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">In a circle the angle in the semicircle is right</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">that in a greater segment less than a right angle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">and that in a less segment greater than a right angle; and further the angle of the greater segment is greater than a right angle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">and the angle of the less segment less than a right angle</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> be a circle, let <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> be its diameter, and <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> its centre, and let <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> be joined; I say that the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> in the semicircle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is right, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> in the segment <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> greater than the semicircle is less  than a right angle, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> in the segment <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> less than the semicircle is greater than a right angle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> be joined, and let <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> be carried through to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABE</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop05">I. 5</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACE</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CAE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop05">I. 5</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the whole angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is equal to the two angles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FAC</span> exterior to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is also equal to the two angles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop32">I. 32</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FAC</span>; therefore each is right; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01def10">I. Def. 10</a>] therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> in the semicircle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is right.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, since in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> the two angles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> are less than two right angles, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop17">I. 17</a>] and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is a right angle, <div class="perseus-center">the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is less than a right angle;</div> and it is the angle in the segment <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> greater than the semicircle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, since <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> is a quadrilateral in a circle, and the opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop22">III. 22</a>] while the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is less than a right angle, therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> which remains is greater than a right angle; and it is the angle in the segment <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> less than the semicircle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say further that the angle of the greater segment, namely that contained by the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> and the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, is greater than a right angle; and the angle of the less segment, namely that contained by the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> and the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, is less than a right angle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">This is at once manifest. For, since the angle contained by the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is right, <div class="perseus-center">the angle contained by the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> and the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is greater than a right angle.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since the angle contained by the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> is right, <div class="perseus-center">the angle contained by the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> and the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> is less than a right angle.</div>

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
