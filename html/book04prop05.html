      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be the given triangle; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the given triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> be bisected at the points <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop10">I. 10</a>], and from the points <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> let <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> be drawn at right angles to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>; they will then meet within the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, or on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, or outside <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">First let them meet within at <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>;</div> so that <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the three straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> are equal to one another.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the circle described with centre <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> and distance one of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> will pass also through the remaining points, and the circle will have been circumscribed about the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be circumscribed, as <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, let <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> meet on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> at <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, as is the case in the second figure; and let <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, similarly, we shall prove that the point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> is the centre of the circle circumscribed about the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, let <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> meet outside the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> at <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, as is the case in the third figure, and let <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then again, since <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>;</div> so that <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>; therefore the circle described with centre <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> and distance one of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> will pass also through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed about the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore about the given triangle a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is manifest that, when the centre of the circle falls within the triangle, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>, being in a segment greater than the semicircle, is less than a right angle; when the centre falls on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>, being in a semicircle, is right; and when the centre of the circle falls outside the triangle, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>, being in a segment less than the semicircle, is greater than a right angle.
