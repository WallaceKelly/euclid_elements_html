      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">If two planes which cut one another be at right angles to any plane</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">their common section will also be at right angles to the same plane.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the two planes <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> be at right angles to the plane of reference, and let <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> be their common section; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For suppose it is not, and from the point <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> let <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> be drawn in the plane <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> at right angles to the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> in the plane <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the plane <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference, and <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> has been drawn in the plane <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, their common section, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11def04">XI. Def. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> is also at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore from the same point <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> two straight lines have been set up at right angles to the plane of reference on the same side: which is impossible. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop13">XI. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore no straight line except the common section <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> of the planes <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> can be set up from the point <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
