      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">To find the fifth binomial straight line</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let two numbers <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> be set out such that <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> has not to either of them the ratio which a square number has to a square number; let any rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> be set out, and let <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> be commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be contrived that, as <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> is binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>] 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that it is also a fifth binomial straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For since, as <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, inversely, as <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let then the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> be equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span>; therefore, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">convertendo</span>, as the number <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop19">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] so that the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and the lesser term <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> set out. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> is a fifth binomial straight line. Q. E. D.</p>
