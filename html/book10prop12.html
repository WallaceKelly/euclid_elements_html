      <p class="perseus-p">For let each of the magnitudes <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> the ratio which a number has to a number.

      <p class="perseus-p">And, given any number of ratios we please, namely the ratio which <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> and that which <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, let the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">L</span> be taken continuously in the given ratios; [cf. <a class="perseus-ref" href="book08prop04">VIII. 4</a>] so that, as <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>, <div class="perseus-center">and, as <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">K</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">L</span>.</div>

      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, while, as <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>, therefore also, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, while, as <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">K</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">L</span>, therefore also, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">K</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">L</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But also, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>; therefore, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">ex aequali</span>, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">L</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>.
