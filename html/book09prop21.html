       <span class="perseus-ital">If as many even numbers as we please be added together, the whole is even.</span>

      <p class="perseus-p">For let as many even numbers as we please, <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, be added together; I say that the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is even. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since each of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is even, it has a half part; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def06">VII. Def. 6</a>] so that the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> also has a half part. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But an even number is that which is divisible into two equal parts; [<span class="perseus-ital">id</span>.] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is even. Q. E. D.</p>
