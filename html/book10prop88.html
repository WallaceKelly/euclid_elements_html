      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">To find the fourth apotome</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let a rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be set out, and <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> commensurable in length with it; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> is also rational. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let two numbers <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> be set out such that the whole <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> has not to either of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be contrived that, as <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span> is also rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span> is rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And both are rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is an apotome. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop73">X. 73</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now let the square on <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> be that by which the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then, as <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span>, therefore also, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">convertendo</span>, as <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GB</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop19">v. 19, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GB</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span> by the square on <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the whole <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> set out. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is a fourth apotome. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def03">X. Deff. III. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the fourth apotome has been found. Q. E. D.</p>
