      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BDC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span>, let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDA</span> be added to each; therefore the whole angle <span class="perseus-emph">BDA</span> is equal to the two angles <span class="perseus-emph">CDA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span>. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BDA</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CBD</span>, since the side <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop05">I. 5</a>] so that the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DBA</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span>. </p>

      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> is by hypothesis equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, <div class="perseus-center">so that the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDA</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop05">I. 5</a>]</div> therefore the angles <span class="perseus-emph">CDA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span> are double of the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span> is equal to the angles <span class="perseus-emph">CDA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span>; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span> is also double of the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CAD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span> is equal to each of the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BDA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DBA</span>; therefore each of the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BDA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DBA</span> is also double of the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the isosceles triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span> has been constructed having each of the angles at the base <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> double of the remaining one. Q. E. F.</p>
