      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">In equal triangles which have one angle equal to one angle the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; and those triangles which have one angle equal to one angle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">and in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">are equal</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span> be equal triangles having one angle equal to one angle, namely the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAE</span>; I say that in the triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, that is to say, that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>.</div>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let them be placed so that <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> is in a straight line with <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> is also in a straight line with <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop14">I. 14</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> is another area, therefore, as the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">CAB</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">EAD</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop07">V. 7</a>] 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-emph">CAB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] and, as <span class="perseus-emph">EAD</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>. [<span class="perseus-emph">id</span>.] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore in the triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, let the sides of the triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span> be reciprocally proportional, that is to say, let <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> be to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> as <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>; I say that the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> be again joined, since, as <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, while, as <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, and, as <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">EAD</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] therefore, as the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">EAD</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore each of the triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EAD</span> has the same ratio to <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">EAD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop09">V. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
