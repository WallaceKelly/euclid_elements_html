       <span class="perseus-ital">If a number be the least that is measured by prime numbers, it will not be measured by any other prime number except those originally measuring it.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the number <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be the least that is measured by the prime numbers <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> will not be measured by any other prime number except <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let it be measured by the prime number <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> not be the same with any one of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, let it measure it according to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is measured by the prime numbers <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if two numbers by multiplying one another make some number, and any prime number measure the product, it will also measure one of the original numbers; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop30">VII. 30</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> will measure one of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now they will not measure <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; for <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is prime and not the same with any one of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore they will measure <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, which is less than <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>: which is impossible, for <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is by hypothesis the least number measured by <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore no prime number will measure <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> except <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
