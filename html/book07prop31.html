       <span class="perseus-ital">Any composite number is measured by some prime number.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be a composite number; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is measured by some prime number. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is composite, some number will measure it. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let a number measure it, and let it be <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, if <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> is prime, what was enjoined will have been done. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But if it is composite, some number will measure it. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let a number measure it, and let it be <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, if <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is prime, what was enjoined will have been done. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But if it is composite, some number will measure it. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Thus, if the investigation be continued in this way, some prime number will be found which will measure the number before it, which will also measure <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if it is not found, an infinite series of numbers will measure the number <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, each of which is less than the other: which is impossible in numbers. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore some prime number will be found which will measure the one before it, which will also measure <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore any composite number is measured by some prime number.
