      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span> be two triangles having one angle equal to one angle, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>, the sides about other angles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span> proportional, so that, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, and, first, each of the remaining angles at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> less than a right angle;  I say that the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> will be equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>, and the remaining angle, namely the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, equal to the remaining angle, the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is unequal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>, one of them is greater. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be greater; and on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, and at the point <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> on it, let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABG</span> be constructed equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop23">I. 23</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since the angle <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABG</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>, therefore the remaining angle <span class="perseus-emph">AGB</span> is equal to the remaining angle <span class="perseus-emph">DFE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop32">I. 32</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABG</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop04">VI. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, so by hypothesis is <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> has the same ratio to each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop09">V. 9</a>]</div> so that the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop05">I. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, by hypothesis, the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is less than a right angle; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span> is also less than a right angle; so that the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AGB</span> adjacent to it is greater than a right angle. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop13">I. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it was proved equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; therefore the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> is also greater than a right angle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it is by hypothesis less than a right angle : which is absurd. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is not unequal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>; therefore it is equal to it. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is also equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>; therefore the remaining angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is equal to the remaining angle at <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop32">I. 32</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, again, let each of the angles at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> be supposed not less than a right angle; I say again that, in this case too, the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>;</div> so that the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop05">I. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is not less than a right angle; therefore neither is the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span> less than a right angle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Thus in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span> the two angles are not less than two right angles: which is impossible. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop17">I. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, once more, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is not unequal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>; therefore it is equal to it. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is also equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>; therefore the remaining angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is equal to the remaining angle at <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>. </p>
