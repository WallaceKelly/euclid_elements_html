       <span class="perseus-ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the third binomial, the “side”
 of the area is the irrational straight line called a second bimedial.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the area <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> and the third binomial <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> divided into its terms at <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, of which terms <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is the greater; I say that the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the irrational straight line called a second bimedial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the same construction be made as before. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is a third binomial straight line, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, and neither of the terms <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 3</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, in manner similar to the foregoing, we shall prove that <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only; so that <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is bimedial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is next to be proved that it is also a second bimedial straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, that is, with <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And they are rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-ital">MR</span>, is medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is contained by <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> is medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is a second bimedial straight line. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop38">X. 38</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
