      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be cube numbers, and let <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> be the side of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>; I say that between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> there are two mean proportional numbers, and <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> let it make <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>; let <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, and let the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">K</span> respectively. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is a cube, and <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> its side, and <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason also <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> by multiplying the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> respectively, therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>.
