      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">If two incommensurable magnitudes be added together, the whole will also be incommensurable with each of them; and, if the whole be incommensurable with one of them, the original magnitudes will also be incommensurable</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the two incommensurable magnitudes <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> be added together; I say that the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is also incommensurable with each of the magnitudes <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> are not incommensurable, some magnitude will measure them. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it measure them, if possible, and let it be <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, therefore it will also measure the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it measures <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> also; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> are commensurable; but they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore no magnitude will measure <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> are incommensurable. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def01">X. Def. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are also incommensurable. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is incommensurable with each of the magnitudes <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, let <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> be incommensurable with one of the magnitudes <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">First, let it be incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> are also incommensurable. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if they are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it measure them, and let it be <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. therefore it will also measure the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it measures <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> also; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> are commensurable; but they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore no magnitude will measure <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> are incommensurable.

       <p class="perseus-p">This is indeed at once manifest; for, since <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> is a square, <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>; and <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, that is, the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>. </p>
