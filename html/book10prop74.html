      <p class="perseus-p">For from the medial straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> let there be subtracted the medial straight line <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> which is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> in square only and with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> makes the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> rational;  I say that the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is irrational; and let it be called a <span class="perseus-bold">first apotome of a medial</span> straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> are medial, the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> are also medial. </p>
