      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">Given two commensurable magnitudes, to find their greatest common measure</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the two given commensurable magnitudes be <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> of which <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is the less; thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now the magnitude <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> either measures <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> or it does not. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">If then it measures it—and it measures itself also—<span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is a common measure of <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for a greater magnitude than the magnitude <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> will not measure <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> not measure <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, if the less be continually subtracted in turn from the greater, that which is left over will sometime measure the one before it, because <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> are not incommensurable; [cf. <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop02">X. 2</a>] let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, measuring <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span>, leave <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span> less than itself, let <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span>, measuring <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>, leave <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> less than itself, and let <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> measure <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> will also measure <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it measures itself also; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> will also measure the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> will also measure <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it measures <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span> also; therefore it also measures the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> is a common measure of <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that it is also the greatest. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if not, there will be some magnitude greater than <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> which will measure <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> will also measure <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it measures the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> also; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> will also measure the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> will also measure <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it measures the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> also, and it will therefore measure the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore no magnitude greater than <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> will measure <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> is the greatest common measure of <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the greatest common measure of the two given commensurable magnitudes <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> has been found. Q. E. D. </p>
