      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be the given finite straight line; <div class="perseus-center">thus it is required to cut <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> in extreme and mean ratio.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">On <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> let the square <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> be described; and let there be applied to <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> and exceeding by the figure <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> similar to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop29">VI. 29</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is a square; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is also a square.</div>
       
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, let <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> be subtracted from each; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span> is equal to the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>.</div>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it is also equiangular with it; therefore in <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop14">VI. 14</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, and the greater segment of it is <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>. Q. E. F.</p>
