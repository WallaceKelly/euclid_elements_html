      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If a straight line be cut at random</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments and the square on the aforesaid segment</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be cut at random at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>; I say that the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the square <span class="perseus-emph">CDEB</span> be described on <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop46">I. 46</a>] let <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span> be drawn through to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, and through <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> let <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> be drawn parallel to either <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> or <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop31">I. 31</a>]</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, for it is contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>;</p>
      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, for <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>; <div class="perseus-center">and <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> is the square on <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span></div>. Therefore the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
