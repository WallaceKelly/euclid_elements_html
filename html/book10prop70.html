      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">A straight line commensurable with the side of the sum of two medial areas is the side of the sum of two medial areas</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be the side of the sum of two medial areas, and <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>; it is to be proved that <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is also the side of the sum of two medial areas. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is the side of the sum of two medial areas,  let it be divided into its straight lines at <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, the rectangle contained by them medial, and furthermore the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop41">X. 41</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the same construction be made as before. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">We can then prove similarly that <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> are also incommensurable in square, the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is commensurable with the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, and the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> with the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>; so that the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> is also medial, the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> is medial, and moreover the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is the side of the sum of two medial areas. Q. E. D.</p>
