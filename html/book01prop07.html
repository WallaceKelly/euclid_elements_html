       <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, given two straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> constructed on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> and meeting at the point <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, let two other straight lines 
        <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> be constructed on the same straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, on the same side of it, meeting in another point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> and equal to the former two respectively, namely each to that which has the same extremity with it, so that <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> which has the same extremity <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> with it, and <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> which has the same extremity <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> with it; and let <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> be joined.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop05">I. 5</a>] therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> is greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DCB</span>;</div> therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDB</span> is much greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DCB</span>.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDB</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DCB</span>.</div>
        But it was also proved much greater than it: <div class="perseus-center">which is impossible.</div></p>
