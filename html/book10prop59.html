      <p class="perseus-p">For let the area <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> and the sixth binomial <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, divided into its terms at <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is the greater term; I say that the “side”
 of <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the side of the sum of two medial areas. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the same construction be made as before shown. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is then manifest that <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is the “side”

      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">EA</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span>, that is, the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>, is medial.

      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-ital">MR</span>, that is, the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>, is medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EL.</span> [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span> is the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span> is the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>; therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And each of them is medial, and <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> are incommensurable in square. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is the side of the sum of two medial areas [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop41">X. 41</a>], and is the “side”
