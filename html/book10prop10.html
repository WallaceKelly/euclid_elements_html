      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">To find two straight lines incommensurable, the one in length only, and the other in square also, with an assigned straight line</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be the assigned straight line; thus it is required to find two straight lines incommensurable, the one in length only, and the other in square also, with <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let two numbers <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> be set out which have not to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, that is, which are not similar plane numbers; and let it be contrived that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">D</span></div>
        —for we have learnt how to do this— [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> be taken a mean proportional between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05def09">V. Def. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is also incommensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is incommensurable in square with <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore two straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> have been found incommensurable, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> in length only, and <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> in square and of course in length also, with the assigned straight line <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>.]</p>
