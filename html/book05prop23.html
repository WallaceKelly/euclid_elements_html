      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason also, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">M</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">N</span>.</div> And, as <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore also, as <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">H</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">M</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">N</span>.
