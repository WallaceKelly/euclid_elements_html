      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> be the two given straight lines, and let them be placed so as to contain any angle; thus it is required to find a third proportional to <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let them be produced to the points <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop03">I. 3</a>] let <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> be joined, and through <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> let <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> be drawn parallel to it. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop31">I. 31</a>] 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> has been drawn parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, one of the sides of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>, proportionally, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop02">VI. 2</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>; therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore to two given straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> a third proportional to them, <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>, has been found. Q. E. F.
