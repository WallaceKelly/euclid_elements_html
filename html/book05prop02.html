      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If a first magnitude be the same multiple of a second that a third is of a fourth</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">and a fifth also be the same multiple of the second that a sixth is of the fourth</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">the sum of the first and fifth will also be the same multiple of the second that the sum of the third and sixth is of the fourth</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let a first magnitude, <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, be the same multiple of a second, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, that a third, <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, is of a fourth, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, and let a fifth, <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, also be the same multiple of the second, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, that a sixth, <span class="perseus-emph">EH</span>, is of the fourth <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>;  I say that the sum of the first and fifth, <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>, will be the same multiple of the second, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, that the sum of the third and sixth, <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span>, is of the fourth, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is the same multiple of <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> that <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, so many also are there in <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason also, as many as there are in <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, so many are there also in <span class="perseus-emph">EH</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; therefore, as many as there are in the whole <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, so many also are there in the whole <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, whatever multiple <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, that multiple also is <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span> of <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the sum of the first and fifth, <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>, is the same multiple of the second, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, that the sum of the third and sixth, <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span>, is of the fourth, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q.E.D.</p>
