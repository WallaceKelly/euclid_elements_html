      <p class="perseus-p">For, as the whole <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to the whole <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, so let the part <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> subtracted be to the part <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> subtracted; I say that the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> will also be to the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span> as the whole <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> to the whole <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For since, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, alternately also, as <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the magnitudes are proportional <span class="perseus-emph">componendo</span>, they will also be proportional <span class="perseus-emph">separando</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop17">V. 17</a>] that is, as <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, and, alternately, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, so by hypothesis is the whole <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> to the whole <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> will be to the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span> as the whole <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to the whole <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>.
