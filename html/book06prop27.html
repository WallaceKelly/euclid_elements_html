      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be a straight line and let it be bisected at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>; let there be applied to the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> deficient by the parallelogrammic figure <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> described on the half of <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>;  I say that, of all the parallelograms applied to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> and deficient by parallelogrammic figures similar and similarly situated to <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is greatest. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let there be applied to the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> deficient by the parallelogrammic figure <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span> similar and similarly situated to <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> is similar to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <div class="perseus-center">they are about the same diameter. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop26">VI. 26</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let their diameter <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> be drawn, and let the figure be described. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span>, since <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop36">I. 36</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">GC</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">EK</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> be added to each; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the whole <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> is equal to the gnomon <span class="perseus-emph">LMN</span>;</div> so that the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, is greater than the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>. </p>
