       <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span> be two triangles having the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> respectively, namely <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>, and let the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> be greater than the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>;</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">I say that the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is also greater than the base <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">For, since the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>, let there be constructed, on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, and at the point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> on it, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDG</span>
        equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop23">I. 23</a>] let <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> be made equal to either of the two straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> be joined. 
        </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span>, the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span>, respectively; <div class="perseus-center">and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDG</span>; therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>]</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DGF</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DFG</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop05">I. 5</a>] therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DFG</span> is greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EGF</span>.</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EFG</span> is much greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EGF</span>.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-emph">EFG</span> is a triangle having the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EFG</span>
        greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EGF</span>, <div class="perseus-center">and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop19">I. 19</a>] the side <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>.</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>. <div class="perseus-center">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>.</div>
