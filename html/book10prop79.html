      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be an apotome, and <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> an annex to it; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop73">X. 73</a>] 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that no other rational straight line can be annexed to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> which is commensurable with the whole in square only. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> be so annexed; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> are also rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop73">X. 73</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the excess of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> over twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> is also the excess of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> over twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, for both exceed by the same, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book02prop07">II. 7</a>] therefore, alternately, the excess of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> over the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is the excess of twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> over twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> exceed the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> by a rational area, for both are rational; therefore twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> also exceeds twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> by a rational area: which is impossible, for both are medial [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>], and a medial area does not exceed a medial by a rational area. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop26">X. 26</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore no other rational straight line can be annexed to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> which is commensurable with the whole in square only. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore only one rational straight line can be annexed to an apotome which is commensurable with the whole in square only. Q. E. D.</p>
