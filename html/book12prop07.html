       <span class="perseus-ital">Any prism which has a triangular base is divided into three pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be a prism in which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is the base and <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> its opposite; I say that the prism <span class="perseus-ital">ABCDEF</span> is divided into three pyramids equal to one another, which have triangular bases. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since <span class="perseus-ital">ABED</span> is a parallelogram, and <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> is its diameter, therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">EBD</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop34">I. 34</a>] therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">DEB</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> the vertex. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop05">XII. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">DEB</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> the vertex is the same with the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">EBC</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> the vertex; for they are contained by the same planes. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> the vertex is also equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">EBC</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> the vertex. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">FCBE</span> is a parallelogram, and <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span> is its diameter, the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">CEF</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">CBE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop34">I. 34</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">BCE</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ECF</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> the vertex. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop05">XII. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">BCE</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> the vertex was proved equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> the vertex; therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">CEF</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> the vertex; therefore the prism <span class="perseus-ital">ABCDEF</span> has been divided into three pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> the vertex is the same with the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">CAB</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> the vertex, for they are contained by the same planes, while the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> the vertex was proved to be a third of the prism in which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is the base and <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> its opposite, therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> the vertex is a third of the prism which has the same base, the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> as its opposite. </p>
