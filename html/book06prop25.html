      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">To construct one and the same figure similar to a given rectilineal figure and equal to another given rectilineal figure</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be the given rectilineal figure to which the figure to be constructed must be similar, and <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> that to which it must be equal; thus it is required to construct one and the same figure similar to <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> and equal to <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be applied to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop44">I. 44</a>], and to <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CM</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> in the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FCE</span> which is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CBL</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop45">I. 45</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is in a straight line with <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">LE</span> with <span class="perseus-emph">EM</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now let <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> be taken a mean proportional to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop13">VI. 13</a>], and on <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> let <span class="perseus-emph">KGH</span> be described similar and similarly situated to <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop18">VI. 18</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since, as <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, and, if three straight lines be proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first to the similar and similarly situated figure described on the second, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop19">VI. 19, Por.</a>] therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">KGH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, so also is the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">KGH</span>, so is the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>; therefore, alternately, as the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">KGH</span> to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop16">V. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equal to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>; therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">KGH</span> is also equal to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-emph">KGH</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-emph">KGH</span> is also similar to <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore one and the same figure <span class="perseus-emph">KGH</span> has been constructed similar to the given rectilineal figure <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> and equal to the other given figure <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. Q. E. D.
