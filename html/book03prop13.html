      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">A circle does not touch a circle at more points than one</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">whether it touch it internally or externally</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABDC</span> touch the circle <span class="perseus-emph">EBFD</span>, first internally, at more points than one, namely <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the centre <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABDC</span>, and the centre <span class="perseus-emph">H</span> of <span class="perseus-emph">EBFD</span>, be taken. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the straight line 
       joined from <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">H</span> will fall on <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop11">III. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it so fall, as <span class="perseus-emph">BGHD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since the point <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> is the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">BG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span>;</div>
       <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">HD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-emph">BH</span> is much greater than <span class="perseus-emph">HD</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since the point <span class="perseus-emph">H</span> is the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">EBFD</span>, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">BH</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">HD</span>;</div>
       <div class="perseus-center">but it was also proved much greater than it: which is impossible.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore a circle does not touch a circle internally at more points than one. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say further that neither does it so touch it externally. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ACK</span> touch the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABDC</span> at more points than one, namely <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since on the circumference of each of the circles <span class="perseus-emph">ABDC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ACK</span> two points <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> have been taken at random, the straight line joining the points will fall within each circle; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop02">III. 2</a>] <div class="perseus-center">but it fell within the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> and outside <span class="perseus-emph">ACK</span> [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03def03">III.

       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore a circle does not touch a circle externally at more points than one. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it was proved that neither does it so touch it internally. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
