       <span class="perseus-ital">If two numbers be prime to one another, and numbers fall between them in continued proportion, then, however many numbers fall between them in continued proportion, so many will also fall between each of them and an unit in continued proportion.</span>

      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be two numbers prime to one another, and let <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> fall between them in continued proportion, and let the unit <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> be set out; I say that, as many numbers as fall between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> in continued proportion, so many will also fall between either of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> and the unit in continued proportion. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let two numbers <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, the least that are in the ratio of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, be taken, three numbers <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">L</span> with the same property, and others more by one continually, until their multitude is equal to the multitude of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>.

      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let them be taken, and let them be <span class="perseus-ital">M</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">N</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">O</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">P</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is now manifest that <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">M</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">L</span> and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">L</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">P</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book08prop02">VIII. 2, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">M</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">N</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">O</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">P</span> are the least of those which have the same ratio with <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are also the least of those which have the same ratio with <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book08prop01">VIII. 1</a>] while the multitude of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">M</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">N</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">O</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">P</span> is equal to the multitude of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">M</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">N</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">O</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">P</span> are equal to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> respectively; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">M</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">P</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the unit <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> according to the units in it; therefore the unit <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures the number <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> the same number of times as <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as the unit <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is to the number <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">M</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">M</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the unit <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> also measures the number <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> according to the units in it; therefore the unit <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures the number <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> the same number of times as <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">M</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as the unit <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is to the number <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">M</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it was also proved that, as the unit <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is to the number <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>; therefore also, as the unit <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is to the number <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">M</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">M</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>; therefore, as the unit <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is to the number <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason also, as the unit <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is to the number <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">L</span> and <span class="perseus-ital">L</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as many numbers as have fallen between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> in continued proportion, so many numbers also have fallen between each of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> and the unit <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> in continued proportion.
