      <p class="perseus-p">For let there be set out any rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, and two square numbers <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> such that their difference <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span> is not square; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop28">Lemma 1</a>] let there be described on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> the semicircle <span class="perseus-ital">AFB</span>, and let it be contrived that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6, Por.</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, as the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> is to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>, therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> has to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> the ratio which the number <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> has to the number <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6</a>] 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is rational; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def04">X. Def. 4</a>] therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> is also rational; [<span class="perseus-ital">id.</span>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> is also rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And since, as <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, therefore, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">convertendo</span>, as <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop19">V. 19, Por.</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop31">III. 31</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop47">I. 47</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number: therefore also the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> has to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> by the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span> commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore there have been found two rational straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> commensurable in square only and such that the square on the greater <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on the less <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> by the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span> commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>.</p>
