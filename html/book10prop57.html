       <span class="perseus-ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the fourth binomial, the “side”
 of the area is the irrational straight line called major.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the area <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> and the fourth binomial <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> divided into its terms at <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, of which terms let <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> be the greater; I say that the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the irrational straight line called major. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is a fourth binomial straight line, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> be bisected at <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, and let there be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> a parallelogram, the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span>, equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop18">X. 18</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FL</span> be drawn parallel to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, and let the rest of the construction be as before; it is then manifest that <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is next to be proved that <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is the irrational straight line called major. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AH</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-ital">SN</span> with <span class="perseus-ital">NQ</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> are incommensurable in square. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span> is rational; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop19">X. 19</a>] and it is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>; therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> is also rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, that is, with <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">LE</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-ital">MR</span>, is medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is contained by <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> is medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the [sum] of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> is rational, and <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> are incommensurable in square. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if two straight lines incommensurable in square and making the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial, be added together, the whole is irrational and is called major. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop39">X. 39</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is the irrational straight line called major and is the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AC.</span> Q. E. D.</p>
