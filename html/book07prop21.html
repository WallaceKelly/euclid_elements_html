       <span class="perseus-ital">Numbers prime to one another are the least of those which have the same ratio with them.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be numbers prime to one another; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are the least of those which have the same ratio with them. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if not, there will be some numbers less than <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> which are in the same ratio with <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let them be <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> the same number of times that <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, as many times as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop16">VII. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop16">VII. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> which are prime to one another: which is impossible. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def12">VII. Def. 12</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore there will be no numbers less than <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> which are in the same ratio with <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are the least of those which have the same ratio with them. Q. E. D.</p>
