       <p class="perseus-p">If on one of the sides of a triangle, from its extremities, there be constructed two straight lines meeting within the triangle, the straight lines so constructed will be less than the remaining two sides of the triangle, but will contain a greater angle.</p>

       <p class="perseus-p">On <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, one of the sides of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, from its extremities <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, let the two straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> be constructed meeting within the triangle;</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">I say that <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> are less than the remaining two sides of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, but contain an angle <span class="perseus-emph">BDC</span> greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>. </p>

       <p class="perseus-p">Again, since, in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">CED</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span> are greater than <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, let <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> be added to each; therefore <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> are greater than <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>.</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> were proved greater than <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> are much greater than <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>.</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Again, since in any triangle the exterior angle is greater than the interior and opposite angle, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop16">I. 16</a>] therefore, in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the exterior angle <span class="perseus-emph">BDC</span> is greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CED</span>.</div>

       <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason, moreover, in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABE</span> also, <div class="perseus-center">the exterior angle <span class="perseus-emph">CEB</span> is greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>.</div> But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BDC</span> was proved greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CEB</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BDC</span> is much greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>.</div>
