      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">To find two straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational but the rectangle contained by them medial</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be set out two rational straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> commensurable in square only and such that the square on the greater <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on the less <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop30">X. 30</a>] 
       let <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> be bisected at <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, let there be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> a parallelogram equal to the square on either of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop28">VI. 28</a>] let the semicircle <span class="perseus-ital">AFB</span> be described on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, let <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> be drawn at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> are unequal straight lines, and the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, while there has been applied to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, that is, to the square on half of it, and deficient by a square figure, making the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop18">X. 18</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, as <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, so is the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> to the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, while the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, and the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> is incommensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span> are incommensurable in square. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is rational, therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is also rational; so that the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span> is also rational. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop47">I. 47</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And since, again, the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, and, by hypothesis, the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is also equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is double of <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>, so that the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is also commensurable with the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is medial; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is also medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop23">X. 23, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>; [Lemma] therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span> is also medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it was also proved that the sum of the squares on these straight lines is rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore two straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span> incommensurable in square have been found which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial. Q. E. D.</p>
