      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be the given circle, and <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> the given straight line not greater than the diameter of the circle; thus it is required to fit into the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> a straight line equal to the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Let a diameter <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be drawn. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since the point <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">EAF</span>, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>.</div>
