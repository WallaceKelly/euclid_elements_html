      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">If two magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">the magnitudes will be commensurable</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the two magnitudes <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> have to one another the ratio which the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> has to the number <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; I say that the magnitudes <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are commensurable. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be divided into as many equal parts as there are units in <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> be equal to one of them; and let <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> be made up of as many magnitudes equal to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> as there are units in <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then there are in <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> as many magnitudes equal to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> as there are units in <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, whatever part the unit is of <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, the same part is <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> also; therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, so is the unit to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the unit measures the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And since, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, so is the unit to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, therefore, inversely, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to the unit. [cf. <a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop07">V. 7, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since there are in <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> as many magnitudes equal to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> as there are units in <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is the unit to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it was also proved that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to the unit;</div>
       therefore, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">ex aequali</span>, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop22">v. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>; therefore also, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so is it to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> also. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop09">V. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>; therefore it measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> also. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Further it measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> also; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. </p>
      <div class="perseus-porism" org="uniform" sample="complete">
       
       <p class="perseus-p">From this it is manifest that, if there be two numbers, as <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, and a straight line, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, it is possible to make a straight line [<span class="perseus-ital">F</span>] such that the given straight line is to it as the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is to the number <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">And, if a mean proportional be also taken between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, as <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so will the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, that is, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first to that which is similar and similarly described on the second. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop19">VI. 19, Por.</a>] </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to the number <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; therefore it has been contrived that, as the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is to the number <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so also is the figure on the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to the figure on the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>.
