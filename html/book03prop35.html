      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If in a circle two straight lines cut one another</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">the rectangle contained by the segments of the one is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the other</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For in the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> let the two straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> cut one another at the point <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>; I say that the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> is equal to the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">If now <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> are through the centre, so that <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> is the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>, it is manifest that, <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> being equal, the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> is also equal to the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next let <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> not be through the centre; let the centre of <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> be taken, and let it be <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; from <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> let <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span> be drawn perpendicular to the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> be joined. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> through the centre cuts a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> not through the centre at right angles, <div class="perseus-center">it also bisects it; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop03">III. 3</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">GC</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> has been cut into equal parts at <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> and into unequal parts at <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">GC</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book02prop05">II. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the square on <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> be added; therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> together with the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">GE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span>, and the square on <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop47">I. 47</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason, also, the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> was also proved equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the square on <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> which remains is equal to the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc.</p>
