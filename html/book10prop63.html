      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be a major straight line divided at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>; let <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> be a rational straight line, and to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> let there be applied the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> and producing <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> as its breadth; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is a fourth binomial straight line. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the same construction be made as before shown. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is a major straight line divided at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop39">X. 39</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is rational, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DL</span> is rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is also rational and commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop20">X. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span>, is medial, and it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">ML</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop22">X. 22</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is to be proved that it is also a fourth binomial straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">In manner similar to the foregoing we can prove that <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span>, and that the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is incommensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DH</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if it divide it into incommensurable parts, then the square on the greater will be greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with the greater; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop18">X. 18</a>] therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> set out. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is a fourth binomial straight line. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 4</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
