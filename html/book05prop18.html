      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span> be magnitudes proportional <span class="perseus-foreign-la">separando</span>, so that, as <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>;  I say that they will also be proportional <span class="perseus-foreign-la">componendo</span>, that is, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> be not to <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, then, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, so will <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> be either to some magnitude less than <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> or to a greater. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">First, let it be in that ratio to a less magnitude <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span>, they are magnitudes proportional <span class="perseus-foreign-la">componendo</span>; <div class="perseus-center">so that they will also be proportional <span class="perseus-foreign-la">separando</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop17">V. 17</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But also, by hypothesis, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the first <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span> is greater than the third <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the second <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span> is also greater than the fourth <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop14">V. 14</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it is also less: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, so is not <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> to a less magnitude than <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that neither is it in that ratio to a greater; <div class="perseus-center">it is therefore in that ratio to <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span> itself.</div>

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
