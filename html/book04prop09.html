      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> be the given square; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the square <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> be joined, and let them cut one another at <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is common, therefore the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>; and the base <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop08">I. 8</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAB</span> is bisected by <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that each of the angles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CDA</span> is bisected by the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAB</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EAB</span> is half the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAB</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EBA</span> half the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EAB</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EBA</span>; so that the side <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop06">I. 6</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> is equal to each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the four straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the circle described with centre <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> and distance one of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span> will pass also through the remaining points; and it will have been circumscribed about the square <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be circumscribed, as <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore about the given square a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.</p>
