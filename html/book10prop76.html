      <p class="perseus-p">For from the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> let there be subtracted the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> which is incommensurable in square with the whole and fulfils the given conditions.

      <p class="perseus-p">I say that the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the irrational straight line called <span class="perseus-bold">minor</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is <span class="perseus-bold">rational</span>, while twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is medial, therefore the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>; and, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">convertendo</span>, the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> are incommensurable with the remainder, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> are rational; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is irrational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is irrational. </p>
