       <span class="perseus-ital">From the same point two straight lines cannot be set up at right angles to the same plane on the same side.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, from the same point <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> let the two straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> be set up at right angles to the plane of reference and on the same side, and let a plane be drawn through <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>; it will then make, as section through <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> in the plane of reference, a straight line. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop03">XI. 3</a>] 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it make <span class="perseus-ital">DAE</span>; therefore the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DAE</span> are in one plane. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference, it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11def03">XI. Def. 3</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">DAE</span> meets it and is in the plane of reference; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">CAE</span> is right. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason the angle <span class="perseus-ital">BAE</span> is also right; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">CAE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">BAE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And they are in one plane: which is impossible. </p>
