      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be the given uncut straight line, and <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> the straight line cut at the points <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>; and let them be so placed as to contain any angle; let <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> be joined, and through <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> let <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span> be drawn parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, and through <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> let <span class="perseus-emph">DHK</span> be drawn parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore each of the figures <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">HB</span> is a parallelogram; therefore <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> and <span class="perseus-emph">HK</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">GB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop34">I. 34</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">HE</span> has been drawn parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">KC</span>, one of the sides of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DKC</span>, therefore, proportionally, as <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">KH</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">HD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop02">VI. 2</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">KH</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">HD</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span>; therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span> has been drawn parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">GE</span>, one of the sides of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">AGE</span>, therefore, proportionally, as <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But it was also proved that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span>; therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span>, and, as <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>.</div>

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the given uncut straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> has been cut similarly to the given cut straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>. Q. E. F.</p>
