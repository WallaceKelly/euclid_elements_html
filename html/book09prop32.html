       <span class="perseus-ital">Each of the numbers which are continually doubled beginning from a dyad is even-times even only.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let as many numbers as we please, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, have been continually doubled beginning from the dyad <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are eventimes even only. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now that each of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is even-times even is manifest; for it is doubled from a dyad. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that it is also even-times even only. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let an unit be set out. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit are in continued proportion, and the number <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> after the unit is prime, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, the greatest of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, will not be measured by any other number except <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book09prop13">IX. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And each of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is even; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is even-times even only. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def08">VII. Def. 8</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that each of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is even-times even only. Q. E. D.</p>
