      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">Commensurable magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be commensurable magnitudes; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it measure them, and let it be <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, as many times as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; and, as many times as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, while the unit also measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> according to the units in it, therefore the unit measures the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> the same number of times as the magnitude <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>; therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, so is the unit to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def20">VII. Def. 20</a>] therefore, inversely, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to the unit. [cf. <a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop07">V. 7, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, while the unit also measures <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> according to the units in it, therefore the unit measures <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> the same number of times as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>; therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so is the unit to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it was also proved that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to the unit;</div> therefore, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">ex aequali</span>, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so is the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop22">V. 22</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the commensurable magnitudes <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> have to one another the ratio which the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> has to the number <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
