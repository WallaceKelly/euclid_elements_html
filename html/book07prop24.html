       <span class="perseus-ital">If two numbers be prime to any number, their product also will be prime to the same.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the two numbers <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be prime to any number <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are prime to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are not prime to one another, some number will measure <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let a number measure them, and let it be <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> are prime to one another, and a certain number <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> are prime to one another. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop23">VII. 23</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">As many times, then, as <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop16">VII. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def15">VII. Def. 15</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, further, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> has also made <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; therefore the product of <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> is equal to the product of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if the product of the extremes be equal to that of the means, the four numbers are proportional; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop19">VII. 19</a>] therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> are prime to one another, numbers which are prime to one another are also the least of those which have the same ratio, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop21">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it also measures <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> which are prime to one another: which is impossible. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def12">VII. Def. 12</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore no number will measure the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
