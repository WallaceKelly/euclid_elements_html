      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be the given straight line and <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> the given rectilineal figure; thus it is required to describe on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> a rectilineal figure similar and similarly situated to the rectilineal figure <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> be joined, and on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, and at the points <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> on it, let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">GAB</span> be constructed equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABG</span> equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDF</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the remaining angle <span class="perseus-emph">CFD</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AGB</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop32">I. 32</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">FCD</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">GAB</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, proportionally, as <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">GB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, and at the points <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> on it, let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGH</span> be constructed equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DFE</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">GBH</span> equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FDE</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But it was also proved that, as <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">GB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore also, as <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span>, and further <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">HB</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CFD</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AGB</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DFE</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGH</span>, therefore the whole angle <span class="perseus-emph">CFE</span> is equal to the whole angle <span class="perseus-emph">AGH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason <div class="perseus-center">the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABH</span>.</div>

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AH</span> is equiangular with <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>; and they have the sides about their equal angles proportional; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the rectilineal figure <span class="perseus-emph">AH</span> is similar to the rectilineal figure <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>.
