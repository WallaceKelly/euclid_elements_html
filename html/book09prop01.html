       <span class="perseus-ital">If two similar plane numbers by multiplying one another make some number, the product will be square.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be two similar plane numbers, and let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is square. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is square. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are similar plane numbers, therefore one mean proportional number falls between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book08prop18">VIII. 18</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if numbers fall between two numbers in continued proportion, as many as fall between them, so many also fall between those which have the same ratio; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book08prop08">VIII. 8</a>] so that one mean proportional number falls between <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> also. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is square; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is also square. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book08prop22">VIII. 22</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
