      <p class="perseus-p">I say that the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> are equal to twice the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> and the square on <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the square <span class="perseus-emph">ADEB</span> be described on <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop46">I. 46</a>] and let the figure be drawn.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">GE</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop43">I. 43</a>] let <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> be added to each; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the whole <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> is equal to the whole <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>.</div></p>

      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> are the gnomon <span class="perseus-emph">KLM</span> and the square <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>; therefore the gnomon <span class="perseus-emph">KLM</span> and the square <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> are double of <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is also double of <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>; for <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>; therefore the gnomon <span class="perseus-emph">KLM</span> and the square <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> are equal to twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span>, which is the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, be added to each; therefore the gnomon <span class="perseus-emph">KLM</span> and the squares <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span> are equal to twice the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> and the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>.</p>
