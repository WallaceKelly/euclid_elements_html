      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span> be similar triangles having the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, and such that, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, so that <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> corresponds to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05def11">V. Def. 11</a>] I say that the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> has to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span> a ratio duplicate of that which <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> has to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">For let a third proportional <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span> be taken to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, so that, as <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop11">VI. 11</a>] and let <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, therefore, alternately, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop16">V. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>; therefore also, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore in the triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But those triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, and in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, are equal; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop15">VI. 15</a>] therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABG</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now since, as <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, and, if three straight lines be proportional, the first has to the third a ratio duplicate of that which it has to the second, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05def09">V. Def. 9</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> has to <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span> a ratio duplicate of that which <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>
       has to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABG</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> also has to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABG</span> a ratio duplicate of that which <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> has to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABG</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>; therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> also has to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span> a ratio duplicate of that which <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> has to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>. </p>
