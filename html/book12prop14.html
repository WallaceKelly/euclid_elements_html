       <span class="perseus-ital">Cones and cylinders which are on equal bases are to one another as their heights.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> be cylinders on equal bases, the circles <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>; I say that, as the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, so is the axis <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> to the axis <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the axis <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span> be produced to the point <span class="perseus-ital">N</span>, let <span class="perseus-ital">LN</span> be made equal to the axis <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>, and let the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span> be conceived about <span class="perseus-ital">LN</span> as axis. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then the cylinders <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span> are of the same height, they are to one another as their bases. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop11">XII. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the bases are equal to one another; therefore the cylinders <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span> are also equal. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">FM</span> has been cut by the plane <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> which is parallel to its opposite planes, therefore, as the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span> is to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, so is the axis <span class="perseus-ital">LN</span> to the axis <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop13">XII. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span> is equal to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, and the axis <span class="perseus-ital">LN</span> to the axis <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>; therefore, as the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, so is the axis <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> to the axis <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, so is the cone <span class="perseus-ital">ABG</span> to the cone <span class="perseus-ital">CDK</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop10">XII. 10</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as the axis <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> is to the axis <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, so is the cone <span class="perseus-ital">ABG</span> to the cone <span class="perseus-ital">CDK</span> and the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> to the cylinder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>.
