      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> be similar parallelepipedal solids, and let <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> be the side corresponding to <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>; I say that the solid <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> has to the solid <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> the ratio triplicate of that which <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EM</span> be produced in a straight line with <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HE</span>, let <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span> equal to <span class="perseus-ital">FN</span>, and further <span class="perseus-ital">EM</span> equal to <span class="perseus-ital">FR</span>, and let the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span> and the solid <span class="perseus-ital">KP</span> be completed. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">KE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FN</span>, while the angle <span class="perseus-ital">KEL</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">CFN</span>, inasmuch as the angle <span class="perseus-ital">AEG</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">CFN</span> because of the similarity of the solids <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, therefore the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span> is equal &lt;and similar&gt; to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">CN</span>. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">But the former three parallelograms are equal and similar to their opposites, and the latter three to their opposites; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop24">XI. 24</a>] therefore the whole solid <span class="perseus-ital">KP</span> is equal and similar to the whole solid <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Then since; owing to the similarity of the solids <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, as <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">FN</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">FR</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FN</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">FR</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">EM</span>, therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">HE</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">EM</span>. </p>
