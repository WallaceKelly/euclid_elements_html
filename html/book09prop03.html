       <span class="perseus-ital">If a cube number by multiplying itself make some number, the product will be cube.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the cube number <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> is cube. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, the side of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, be taken, and let <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is then manifest that <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> according to the units in itself. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But further the unit also measures <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> according to the units in it; therefore, as the unit is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the unit also measures <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> according to the units in it; therefore, as the unit is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the unit is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; therefore also, as the unit is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore between the unit and the number <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> two mean proportional numbers <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> have fallen in continued proportion. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> according to the units in itself. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the unit also measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> according to the units in it; therefore, as the unit is to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But between the unit and <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> two mean proportional numbers have fallen; therefore two mean proportional numbers will also fall between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book08prop08">VIII. 8</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if two mean proportional numbers fall between two numbers, and the first be cube, the second will also be cube. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book08prop23">VIII. 23</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is cube; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> is also cube. Q. E. D.</p>
