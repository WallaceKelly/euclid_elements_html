      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be two numbers prime to one another, let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>; I say that both <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> and <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> are prime to one another.
