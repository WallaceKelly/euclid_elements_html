      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be a circle about <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> as centre and <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> as diameter; I say that the straight line drawn from <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> at right angles to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> from its extremity will fall outside the circle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall within as <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>, 
       <div class="perseus-center">the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop05">I. 5</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span> is right; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span> is also right:</div> thus, in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span>, the two angles <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span> are equal to two right angles: which is impossible. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop17">I. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the straight line drawn from the point <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> at right angles to <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> will not fall within the circle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference; <div class="perseus-center">therefore it will fall outside.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it fall as <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>; I say next that into the space between the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> and the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">CHA</span> another straight line cannot be interposed. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let another straight line be so interposed, as <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> be drawn from the point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> perpendicular to <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AGD</span> is right, <div class="perseus-center">and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAG</span> is less than a right angle, <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop19">I. 19</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span>, the less than the greater: which is impossible.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore another straight line cannot be interposed into the space between the straight line and the circumference. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say further that the angle of the semicircle contained by the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> and the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">CHA</span> is greater than any acute rectilineal angle, and the remaining angle contained by the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">CHA</span> and the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is less than any acute rectilineal angle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if there is any rectilineal angle greater than the angle contained by the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> and the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">CHA</span>, and any rectilineal angle less than the angle contained by the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">CHA</span> and the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, then into the space between the circumference and the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> a straight line will be interposed such as will make an angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> and the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">CHA</span>, and another angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">CHA</span> and the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But such a straight line cannot be interposed; </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">therefore there will not be any acute angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> and the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">CHA</span>, nor yet any acute angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">CHA</span> and the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>.â€” </p>
