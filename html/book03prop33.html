      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be the given straight line, and the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to describe on the given straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">The angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is then acute, or right, or obtuse. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">First let it be acute, and, as in the first figure, on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, and at the point <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> be constructed equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> is also acute.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> be drawn at right angles to <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>, let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be bisected at <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, let <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> be drawn from the point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> at right angles to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">GB</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> is common, <div class="perseus-center">the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>;</div> and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AFG</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BFG</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the circle described with centre <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> and distance <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span> will pass through <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> also. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be drawn, and let it be <span class="perseus-emph">ABE</span>; let <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is drawn from <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, the extremity of the diameter <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, at right angles to <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> touches the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop16">III. 16, Por.</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> touches the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABE</span>, and from the point of contact at <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is drawn across in the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABE</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAB</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AEB</span> in the alternate segment of the circle. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop32">III. 32</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAB</span> is equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>; therefore the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AEB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore on the given straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> the segment <span class="perseus-emph">AEB</span> of a circle has been described admitting the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AEB</span> equal to the given angle, the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next let the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> be right;  and let it be again required to describe on <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the right angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> be constructed equal to the right angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, as is the case in the second figure; let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be bisected at <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, and with centre <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> and distance either <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> or <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span> let the circle <span class="perseus-emph">AEB</span> be described. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> touches the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABE</span>, because the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is right. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop16">III. 16, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> is equal to the angle in the segment <span class="perseus-emph">AEB</span>, for the latter too is itself a right angle, being an angle in a semicircle. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop31">III. 31</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> is also equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AEB</span> is also equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore again the segment <span class="perseus-emph">AEB</span> of a circle has been described on <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> admitting an angle equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, let the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> be obtuse;  and on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, and at the point <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> be constructed equal to it, as is the case in the third figure; let <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> be drawn at right angles to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be again bisected at <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, let <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> be drawn at right angles to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">GB</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> is again equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> is common, <div class="perseus-center">the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>;</div> and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AFG</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BFG</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the circle described with centre <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> and distance <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span> will pass through <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> also; let it so pass, as <span class="perseus-emph">AEB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is drawn at right angles to the diameter <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> from its extremity, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> touches the circle <span class="perseus-emph">AEB</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> has been drawn across from the point of contact at <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment <span class="perseus-emph">AHB</span> of the circle.
