      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be incommensurable magnitudes; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> will be commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But it is not; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number.
