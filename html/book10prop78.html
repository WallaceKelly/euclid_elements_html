       <span class="perseus-ital">If from a straight line there be subtracted a straight line which is incommensurable in square with the whole and which with the whole makes the sum of the squares on them medial, twice the rectangle contained by them medial, and further the squares on them incommensurable with twice the rectangle contained by them, the remainder is irrational; and let it be called</span>
       <span class="perseus-bold">that which produces with a medial area a medial whole.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For from the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> let there be subtracted the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> incommensurable in square with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> and fulfilling the given conditions; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop35">X. 35</a>]  I say that the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the irrational straight line called <span class="perseus-bold">that which produces with a medial area a medial whole</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let a rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DI</span> be set out, to <span class="perseus-ital">DI</span> let there be applied <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, producing <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> as breadth, and let <span class="perseus-ital">DH</span> equal to twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> be subtracted. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book02prop07">II. 7</a>] so that <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the “side”
 of <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is medial and is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DI</span>, producing <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DI</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop22">X. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is medial and is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">DH</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DH</span> is medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DI</span>, producing <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DI</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop22">X. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">DH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">DH</span>, so also is <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And both are rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">GD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is an apotome. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop73">X. 73</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">FH</span> is rational; but the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and an apotome is irrational, [deduction from <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop20">X. 20</a>] and its “side”
 is irrational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the “side”
 of <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is irrational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And let it be called <span class="perseus-bold">that which produces with a medial area a medial whole</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
