      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">To find two rational straight lines commensurable in square only and such that the square on the greater is greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with the greater</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be set out a rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, and two square numbers <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> such that their sum <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is not square; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop28">Lemma 2</a>]  let there be described on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> the semicircle <span class="perseus-ital">AFB</span>, let it be contrived that, as <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6, Por.</a>] and let <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, in a similar manner to the preceding, we can prove that <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And since, as <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, therefore, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">convertendo</span>, as <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop19">V. 19, Por.</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop31">III. 31</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop47">I. 47</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> by the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span> incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> by the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span> incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>.
