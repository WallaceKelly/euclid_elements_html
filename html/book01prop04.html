       <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span> be two triangles having the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> respectively, namely <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> and <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">I say that the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is also equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> will be equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend, that is, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DFE</span>.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">For, if the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be applied to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>, <div class="perseus-center">and if the point <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> be placed on the point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> and the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> on <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>,</div> then the point <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> will also coincide with <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, because <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>. 
        </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Again, <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> coinciding with <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> will also coincide with <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>, because the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>; <div class="perseus-center">hence the point <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> will also coincide with the point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, because <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is again equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>.</div>
        </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> also coincided with <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>; hence the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> will coincide with the base <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">[For if, when <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> coincides with <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> and <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> with <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> does not coincide with the base <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, two straight lines will enclose a space: which is impossible. <div class="perseus-center">Therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> will coincide with <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>] and will be equal to it. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01cn04">C.N. 4</a>]</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Thus the whole triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> will coincide with the whole triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>, <div class="perseus-center">and will be equal to it.</div>
        </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">And the remaining angles will also coincide with the remaining angles and will be equal to them, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DFE</span>.</p>
