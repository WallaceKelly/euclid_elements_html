      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be medial, and let <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> is also medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let a rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> be set out,  and to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> let the rectangular area <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be applied, producing <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop22">X. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And let the rectangular area <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, producing <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> as breadth. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is also commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, as <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> is also rational [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def03">X.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> are rational and commensurable in square only. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the straight line the square on which is equal to the rectangle contained by rational straight lines commensurable in square only is medial; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>] therefore the side of the square equal to the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> is medial. </p>

       <p class="perseus-p">From this it is manifest that an area commensurable with a medial area is medial.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">[And in the same way as was explained in the case of rationals [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop18">Lemma following X. 18</a>] it follows, as regards medials, that a straight line commensurable in length with a medial straight line is called <span class="perseus-bold">medial</span> and commensurable with it not only in length but in square also, since, in general, straight lines commensurable in length are always commensurable in square also. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">But, if any straight line be commensurable in square with a medial straight line, then, if it is also commensurable in length with it, the straight lines are called, in this case too, medial and commensurable in length and in square, but, if in square only, they are called medial straight lines commensurable in square only.]</p>
