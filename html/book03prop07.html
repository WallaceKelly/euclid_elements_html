      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If on the diameter of a circle a point be taken which is not the centre of the circle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">and from the point straight lines fall upon the circle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">that will be greatest on which the centre is</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">the remainder of the same diameter will be least</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">and of the rest</span>
       <span class="perseus-emph">the nearer to the straight line through the centre is always greater than the more remote</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">and only two equal straight lines will fall from the point on the circle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">one on each side of the least straight line</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> be a circle, and let <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> be a diameter of it; on <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> let a point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> be taken which is not the centre of the circle, let <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> be the centre of the circle, and from <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> let straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> fall upon the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> is greatest, <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span> is least, and of the rest <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> than <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GE</span> be joined. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since in any triangle two sides are greater than the remaining one, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop20">I. 20</a>] <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> are greater than <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> is common, the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BEF</span> is also greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CEF</span>; therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span> is greater than the base <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop24">I. 24</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>.</div>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> are greater than <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">GF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> are greater than <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> be subtracted from each; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> is greater than the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> is greatest, <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span> is least, and <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> than <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say also that from the point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> only two equal straight lines will fall on the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>, one on each side of the least <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, and at the point <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> on it, let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FEH</span> be constructed equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">GEF</span> [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop23">I. 23</a>], and let <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">GE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">EH</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> is common, <div class="perseus-center">the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">GE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">HE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>; and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">GEF</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">HEF</span>;</div>
       <div class="perseus-center">therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say again that another straight line equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> will not fall on the circle from the point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let <span class="perseus-emph">FK</span> so fall. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">FK</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">FK</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span>, the nearer to the straight line through the centre being thus equal to the more remote: which is impossible.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore another straight line equal to <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> will not fall from the point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> upon the circle; <div class="perseus-center">therefore only one straight line will so fall.</div>
