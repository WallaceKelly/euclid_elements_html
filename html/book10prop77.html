      <p class="perseus-p">For from the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> let there be subtracted the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> which is incommensurable in square with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> and fulfils the given conditions; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop34">X. 34</a>] I say that the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the irrational straight line aforesaid. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is medial, while twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is rational, therefore the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> are incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>; therefore the remainder also, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, is incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">And twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is irrational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is irrational. </p>
