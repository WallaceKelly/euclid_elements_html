      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">If two medial areas incommensurable with one another be added together, the remaining two irrational straight lines arise, namely either a second bimedial or a side of the sum of two medial areas</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let two medial areas <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> incommensurable with one another be added together; I say that the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is either a second bimedial or a side of the sum of two medial areas. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is either greater or less than <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">First, if it so chance, let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be greater than <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> be set out, and to <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> let there be applied the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> equal to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> and producing <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span> as breadth, and the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">HI</span> equal to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> and producing <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> as breadth. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since each of the areas <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is medial, therefore each of the areas <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HI</span> is also medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And they are applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>, producing <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> as breadth; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop22">X. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">HI</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">HI</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">HI</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span> is binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> either by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with itself. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now neither of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> set out; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span> is a third binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 3</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is rational; and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the third binomial, the “side”
 of the area is a second bimedial; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop56">X. 56</a>] therefore the “side”
 of <span class="perseus-ital">EI</span>, that is, of <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, is a second bimedial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, let the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span> be greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span> is a sixth binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 6</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the sixth binomial, the “side”
 of the area is the side of the sum of two medial areas; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop59">X. 59</a>] so that the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is also the side of the sum of two medial areas. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
