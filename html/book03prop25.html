      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">Given a segment of a circle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">to describe the complete circle of which it is a segment</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be the given segment of a circle; thus it is required to describe the complete circle belonging to the segment <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, that is, of which it is a segment. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> be bisected at <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, let <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> be drawn from the point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> at right angles to <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>. be joined; <div class="perseus-center">the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span> is then greater than, equal to, or less than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">First let it be greater; and on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, and at the point <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> on it, let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAE</span> be constructed equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>; let <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> be drawn through to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAE</span>, 
       <div class="perseus-center">the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop06">I. 6</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> is common, <div class="perseus-center">the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> respectively;</div> and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span>, for each is right; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> was proved equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>;</div> therefore the three straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the circle drawn with centre <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> and distance one of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> will also pass through the remaining points and will have been completed. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop09">III. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is manifest that the segment <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is less than a semicircle, because the centre <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> happens to be outside it. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly, even if the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span> be equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> being equal to each of the two <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the three straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> will be equal to one another, 
        <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> will be the centre of the completed circle, and <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> will clearly be a semicircle.</div>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span> be less than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, and if we construct, on the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> and at the point <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> on it, an angle equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>, the centre will fall on <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> within the segment <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, and the segment 
       <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> will clearly be greater than a semicircle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described. Q. E. F.
