      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">In a given pentagon</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">which is equilateral and equiangular</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">to inscribe a circle</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDE</span> be the given equilateral and equiangular pentagon; thus it is required to inscribe a circle in the pentagon <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span> be bisected by the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> respectively; and from the point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, at which the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> meet one another, let the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> common, the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>;  and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BCF</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DCF</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>,</div> and the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BCF</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DCF</span>, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CBF</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span> is double of the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDF</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, while the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDF</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CBF</span>; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CBA</span> is also double of the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CBF</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABF</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FBC</span>;</div> therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> has been bisected by the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly it can be proved that the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BAE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AED</span> have also been bisected by the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> respectively. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now let <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FL</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FM</span> be drawn from the point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> perpendicular to the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since the angle <span class="perseus-emph">HCF</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">KCF</span>, and the right angle <span class="perseus-emph">FHC</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FKC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FHC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FKC</span> are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> which is common to them and subtends one of the equal angles; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop26">I. 26</a>] therefore the perpendicular <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span> is equal to the perpendicular <span class="perseus-emph">FK</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FL</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FM</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> is also equal to each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FK</span>; therefore the five straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FL</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FM</span> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the circle described with centre <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> and distance one of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FL</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FM</span> will pass also through the remaining points; and it will touch the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>, because the angles at the points <span class="perseus-emph">G</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">H</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">K</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">L</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">M</span> are right. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if it does not touch them. but cuts them, it will result that the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its extremity falls within the circle: which was proved absurd. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop16">III. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the circle described with centre <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> and distance one of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FL</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FM</span> will not cut the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore it will touch them.</div>

      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be described, as <span class="perseus-emph">GHKLM</span>. </p>
