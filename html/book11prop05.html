      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">If a straight line be set up at right angles to three straight lines which meet one another</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">at their common point of section</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">the three straight lines are in one plane.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let a straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be set up at right angles to the three straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, at their point of meeting at <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span> are in one plane. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For suppose they are not, but, if possible, let <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span> be in the plane of reference and <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> in one more elevated; let the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> be produced; it will thus make, as common section in the plane of reference, a straight line. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop03">XI. 3</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it make <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the three straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span> are in one plane, namely that drawn through <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop04">XI. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span> is the plane of reference; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Thus <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11def03">XI. Def. 3</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span> which is in the plane of reference meets it; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">ABF</span> is right. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, by hypothesis, the angle <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is also right; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">ABF</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And they are in one plane: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is not in a more elevated plane; therefore the three straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span> are in one plane. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, if a straight line be set up at right angles to three straight lines, at their point of meeting, the three straight lines are in one plane. Q. E. D.</p>
