      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be a circle, and let a point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> be taken outside <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>; let there be drawn through from it straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> be through the centre; I say that, of the straight lines falling on the concave circumference <span class="perseus-emph">AEFC</span>, the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> through the centre is greatest,  while <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> and <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> than <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>.; but, of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference <span class="perseus-emph">HLKG</span>, the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> between the point and the diameter <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> is least; and the nearer to the least <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> is always less than the more remote, namely <span class="perseus-emph">DK</span> than <span class="perseus-emph">DL</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">DL</span> than <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be taken [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop01">III. 1</a>], and let it be <span class="perseus-emph">M</span>; let <span class="perseus-emph">ME</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">MF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">MC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">MK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ML</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">MH</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">AM</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">EM</span>, let <span class="perseus-emph">MD</span> be added to each; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">EM</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">MD</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">EM</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">MD</span> are greater than <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop20">I. 20</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-emph">ME</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">MF</span>, <div class="perseus-center">and <span class="perseus-emph">MD</span> is common,</div> therefore <span class="perseus-emph">EM</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">MD</span> are equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FM</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">MD</span>; <div class="perseus-center">and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EMD</span> is greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FMD</span>;</div>
       <div class="perseus-center">therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span> is greater than the base <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop24">I. 24</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> is greatest, while <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> than <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, since <span class="perseus-emph">MK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">KD</span> are greater than <span class="perseus-emph">MD</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop20">I. 20</a>] and <span class="perseus-emph">MG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">MK</span>, therefore the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">KD</span> is greater than the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span>, <div class="perseus-center">so that <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span> is less than <span class="perseus-emph">KD</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since on <span class="perseus-emph">MD</span>, one of the sides of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">MLD</span>, two straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">MK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">KD</span> were constructed meeting within the triangle, therefore <span class="perseus-emph">MK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">KD</span> are less than <span class="perseus-emph">ML</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">LD</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop21">I. 21</a>] and <span class="perseus-emph">MK</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">ML</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">DK</span> is less than the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">DL</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that <span class="perseus-emph">DL</span> is also less than <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> is least, while <span class="perseus-emph">DK</span> is less than <span class="perseus-emph">DL</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">DL</span> than <span class="perseus-emph">DH</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say also that only two equal straight lines will fall from the point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> on the circle, one on each side of the least <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">On the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">MD</span>, and at the point <span class="perseus-emph">M</span> on it, let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DMB</span> be constructed equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">KMD</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">MK</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">MB</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">MD</span> is common, <div class="perseus-center">the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">KM</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">MD</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">BM</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">MD</span> respectively;</div> and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">KMD</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BMD</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">DK</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that no other straight line equal to the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">DK</span> will fall on the circle from the point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let a straight line so fall, and let it be <span class="perseus-emph">DN</span>. <div class="perseus-center">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">DK</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DN</span>,</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">while <span class="perseus-emph">DK</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DN</span>,</div> that is, the nearer to the least <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> equal to the more remote: which was proved impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore no more than two equal straight lines will fall on the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> from the point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, one on each side of <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> the least. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc.</p>
