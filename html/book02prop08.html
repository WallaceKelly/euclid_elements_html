      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If a straight line be cut at random</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">four times the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments together with the square on the remaining segment is equal to the square described on the whole and the aforesaid segment as on one straight line</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be cut at random at the point <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>;</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that four times the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is equal to the square described on <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> as on one straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let [the straight line] <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> be produced in a straight line [with <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>], and let <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>; let the square <span class="perseus-emph">AEFD</span> be described on <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, and let the figure be drawn double.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, while <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">GK</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">KN</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-emph">GK</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">KN</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">QR</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">RP</span>.</div></p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">GK</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">KN</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-emph">CK</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">KD</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">GR</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">RN</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">CK</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">RN</span>, for they are complements of the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CP</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop43">I. 43</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-emph">KD</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">GR</span>; therefore the four areas <span class="perseus-emph">DK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GR</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">RN</span> are equal to one another. <div class="perseus-center">Therefore the four are quadruple of <span class="perseus-emph">CK</span>.</div></p>

      <p class="perseus-p">But the gnomon <span class="perseus-emph">STU</span> was also proved to be quadruple of <span class="perseus-emph">AK</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore four times the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> is equal to the gnomon <span class="perseus-emph">STU</span>.</div></p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">OH</span>, which is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, be added to each; <div class="perseus-center">therefore four times the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is equal to the gnomon <span class="perseus-emph">STU</span> and <span class="perseus-emph">OH</span>.</div></p>
