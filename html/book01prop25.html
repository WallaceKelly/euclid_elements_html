       <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span> be two triangles having the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> respectively, namely <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>; and let the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> be greater than the base <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>;</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">I say that the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is also greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">For, if not, it is either equal to it or less.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Now the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is not equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>; for then the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> would also have been equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>] <div class="perseus-center">but it is not; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is not equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>.</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Neither again is the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> less than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>; for then the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> would also have been less than the base <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop24">I. 24</a>] <div class="perseus-center">but it is not; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is not less than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>.</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">But it was proved that it is not equal either; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>.</div></p>
