       <span class="perseus-ital">Pyramids which are of the same height and have triangular bases are to one another as the bases.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be pyramids of the same height, of which the triangles <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> are the bases and the points <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> the vertices; I say that, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> to the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> is not to the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, then, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so will the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> be either to some solid less than the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> or to a greater. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it, first, be in that ratio to a less solid <span class="perseus-ital">W</span>, and let the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> be divided into two pyramids equal to one another and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms; then the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop03">XII. 3</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, let the pyramids arising from the division be similarly divided, and let this be done continually until there are left over from the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> some pyramids which are less than the excess by which the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> exceeds the solid <span class="perseus-ital">W</span>. [X. I] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let such be left, and let them be, for the sake of argument, <span class="perseus-ital">DQRS</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">STUH</span>; therefore the remainders, the prisms in the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>, are greater than the solid <span class="perseus-ital">W</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> also be divided similarly, and a similar number of times, with the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>; therefore, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so are the prisms in the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> to the prisms in the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop04">XII. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so also is the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> to the solid <span class="perseus-ital">W</span>; therefore also, as the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> is to the solid <span class="perseus-ital">W</span>, so are the prisms in the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> to the prisms in the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>; [V. II] therefore, alternately, as the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> is to the prisms in it, so is the solid <span class="perseus-ital">W</span> to the prisms in the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop16">V. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> is greater than the prisms in it; therefore the solid <span class="perseus-ital">W</span> is also greater than the prisms in the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it is also less: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the prism <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> is not to any solid less than the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly it can be proved that neither is the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> to any solid less than the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> as the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that neither is the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> to any solid greater than the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let it be in that ratio to a greater solid <span class="perseus-ital">W</span>; therefore, inversely, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>, so is the solid <span class="perseus-ital">W</span> to the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the solid <span class="perseus-ital">W</span> is to the solid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> to some solid less than the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>, as was before proved; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop02">XII. 2, Lemma</a>] therefore also, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> to some solid less than the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>: [V. II] which was proved absurd. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> is not to any solid greater than the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it was proved that neither is it in that ratio to a less solid. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so is the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> to the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
