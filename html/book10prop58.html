       <span class="perseus-ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the fifth binomial, the “side”
 of the area is the irrational straight line called the side of a rational plus a medial area.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the area <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> and the fifth binomial <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> divided into its terms at <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is the greater term; I say that the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the irrational straight line called the side of a rational plus a medial area. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the same construction be made as before shown; it is then manifest that <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AC.</span>
       
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is then to be proved that <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is the side of a rational plus a medial area. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop18">X. 18</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AH</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">HE</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] that is, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> are incommensurable in square. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is a fifth binomial straight line, and <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> the lesser segment, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AE.</span> [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span>, that is, the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>, is medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, that is, with <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EK.</span> [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop12">X. 12</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span> is rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-ital">MR</span>, that is, the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>, is also rational. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop19">X. 19</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is the side of a rational plus a medial area [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop40">X. 40</a>] and is the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AC.</span> Q. E. D.</p>
