      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be three magnitudes <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, and others <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> equal to them in multitude, which taken two and two are in the same ratio, so that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>,</div> and as <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; and let <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> be greater than <span class="perseus-emph">C</span><span class="perseus-foreign-la"> ex aequali</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> will also be greater than <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; if <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, equal; and, if less, less. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is some other magnitude, and the greater has to the same a greater ratio than the less has, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop08">V. 8</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> a greater ratio than <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> has to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, and, as <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, inversely, so is <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> has also to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> a greater ratio than <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> has to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop13">V. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, of magnitudes which have a ratio to the same, that which has a greater ratio is greater; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop10">V. 10</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>.</div>

      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that, if <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> be equal to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> will also be equal to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; and if less, less. </p>
