      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If two circles touch one another internally</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">and their centres be taken</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">the straight line joining their centres</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">if it be also produced</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">will fall on the point of contact of the circles</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the two circles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span> touch one another internally at the point <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, and let the centre <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, and the centre <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> of <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>, be taken; I say that the straight line joined from <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> and produced will fall on <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall as <span class="perseus-emph">FGH</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> are greater than <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, that is, than <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span>, </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">let <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> is greater than the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span>, the less than the greater: which is impossible.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the straight line joined from <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> will not fall outside; <div class="perseus-center">therefore it will fall at <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> on the point of contact.</div>
