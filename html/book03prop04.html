      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If in a circle two straight lines cut one another which are not through the centre</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">they do not bisect one another</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> be a circle, and in it let the two straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, which are not through the centre, cut one another at <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>;  I say that they do not bisect one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let them bisect one another, so that <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>; let the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> be taken [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop01">III. 1</a>], and let it be <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; let <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> through the centre bisects a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> not through the centre, <div class="perseus-center">it also cuts it at right angles; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop03">III. 3</a>] therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FEA</span> is right.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> bisects a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, <div class="perseus-center">it also cuts it at right angles; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop03">III. 3</a>] therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FEB</span> is right.</div>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FEA</span> was also proved right; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FEA</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FEB</span>, the less to the greater: which is impossible.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> do not bisect one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
