      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">About a given pentagon</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">which is equilateral and equiangular</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">to circumscribe a circle</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDE</span> be the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the pentagon <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span> be bisected by the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> respectively, and from the point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, at which the straight lines meet, let the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> be joined to the points <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then in manner similar to the preceding it can be proved that the angles <span class="perseus-emph">CBA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BAE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AED</span> have also been bisected by the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> respectively. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FCD</span> is half of the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDF</span> half of the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span>, therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FCD</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDF</span>, <div class="perseus-center">so that the side <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> is also equal to the side <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop06">I. 6</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> is also equal to each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>; therefore the five straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the circle described with centre <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> and distance one of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> will pass also through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be circumscribed, and let it be <span class="perseus-emph">ABCDE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore about the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular, a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.</p>
