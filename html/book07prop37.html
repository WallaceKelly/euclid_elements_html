       <span class="perseus-ital">If a number be measured by any number, the number which is measured will have a part called by the same name as the measuring number.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the number <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be measured by any number <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has a part called by the same name as <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, as many times as <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, and the unit <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> also measures the number <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> according to the units in it, therefore the unit <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> measures the number <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> the same number of times as <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, alternately, the unit <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> measures the number <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the same number of times as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop15">VII. 15</a>] therefore, whatever part the unit <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is of the number <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, the same part is <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> also. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the unit <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is a part of the number <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> called by the same name as it; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is also a part of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> called by the same name as <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has a part <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> which is called by the same name as <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>.
