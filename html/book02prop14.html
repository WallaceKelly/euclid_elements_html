      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> be the given rectilineal figure; thus it is required to construct a square equal to the rectilineal figure <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>. 
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let there be constructed the rectangular parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> equal to the rectilineal figure <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop45">I. 45</a>]</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, if <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, that which was enjoined will have been done; for a square <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> has been constructed equal to the rectilineal figure <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if not, one of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span> is greater.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> be greater, and let it be produced to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; let <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span> be bisected at <span class="perseus-emph">G</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">With centre <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> and distance one of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">GB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> let the semicircle <span class="perseus-emph">BHF</span> be described; let <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> be produced to <span class="perseus-emph">H</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> be joined.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BF</span> has been cut into equal segments at <span class="perseus-emph">G</span>, and into unequal segments at <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book02prop05">II. 5</a>]</div>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span>; therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">GE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">HE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span> are equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop47">I. 47</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">GE</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">HE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the square on <span class="perseus-emph">GE</span> be subtracted from each; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> which remains is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">EH</span>.</div>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> is <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, for <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">HE</span>.</div></p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> is equal to the rectilineal figure <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the rectilineal figure <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is also equal to the square which can be described on <span class="perseus-emph">EH</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore a square, namely that which can be described on <span class="perseus-emph">EH</span>, has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>. Q. E. F.</p>
