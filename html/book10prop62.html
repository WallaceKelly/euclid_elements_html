      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">The square on the second bimedial straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the third binomial</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be a second bimedial straight line divided into its medials at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the greater segment; let <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> be any rational straight line, and to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> let there be applied the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> and producing <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> as its breadth;  I say that <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is a third binomial straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the same construction be made as before shown. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is a second bimedial divided at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop38">X. 38</a>] so that the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is also medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop15">X. 15</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop23">X. 23 Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">DL</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DL</span> is also medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MD</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop22">X. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason, <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">ML</span>, that is, with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, and, as <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> to the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is also incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Hence the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop12">X. 12</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] that is, <span class="perseus-ital">DL</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And they are rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is to be proved that it is also a third binomial straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">In manner similar to the foregoing we may conclude that <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span>, and that <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And neither of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is a third binomial straight line. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 3</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
