      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">If two straight lines be at right angles to the same plane</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">the straight lines will be parallel.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the two straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> be at right angles to the plane of reference; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is parallel to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let them meet the plane of reference at the points <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, let the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> be joined, let <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> be drawn, in the plane of reference, at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, let <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference, it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11def03">XI. Def. 3</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span> is in the plane of reference and meets <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>; therefore each of the angles <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ABE</span> is right. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason each of the angles <span class="perseus-ital">CDB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CDE</span> is also right. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> is common, the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>; and they include right angles; therefore the base <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span>; and <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is their common base; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">ABE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">EDA</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop08">I. 8</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-ital">ABE</span> is right; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">EDA</span> is also right; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it is also at right angles to each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is set up at right angles to the three straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> at their point of meeting; therefore the three straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> are in one plane. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop05">XI. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, in whatever plane <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span> are, in that plane is <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> also, for every triangle is in one plane; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop02">XI. 2</a>] therefore the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> are in one plane. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And each of the angles <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BDC</span> is right; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is parallel to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop28">I. 28</a>] </p>
