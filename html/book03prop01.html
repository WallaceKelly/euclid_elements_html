      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">To find the centre of a given circle</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be the given circle; thus it is required to find the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be drawn through it at random, and let it be bisected at the point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>; from <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> let <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> be drawn at right angles to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> and let it be drawn through to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>; let <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> be bisected at <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> is the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> be the centre, and let <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GB</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> is common, <div class="perseus-center">the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> respectively;</div> and the base <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">GB</span>, for they are radii; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ADG</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">GDB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop08">I. 8</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01def10">I. Def. 10</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">GDB</span> is right.</div>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FDB</span> is also right; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FDB</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">GDB</span>, the greater to the less: which is impossible. <div class="perseus-center">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> is not the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>.</div>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. <div class="perseus-center">Therefore the point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> is the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>.</div>
