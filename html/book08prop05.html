      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be plane numbers, and let the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> be the sides of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.

      <p class="perseus-p">For, the ratios being given which <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> and <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, let the least numbers <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">K</span> that are continuously in the ratios <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> : <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> : <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> be taken, so that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>,</div> and, as <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But it was also proved that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">L</span>;</div> therefore, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">ex aequali</span>, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>.
