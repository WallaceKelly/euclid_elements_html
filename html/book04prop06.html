      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe a square in the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let two diameters <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> be drawn at right angles to one another, and let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> be joined. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, for <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> is the centre, and <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> is also equal to each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the quadrilateral <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> is equilateral.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that it is also right-angled. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> is a diameter of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> is a semicircle; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> is right. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop31">III. 31</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason each of the angles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CDA</span> is also right; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the quadrilateral <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> is right-angled.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it was also proved equilateral; therefore it is a square; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01def22">I. Def. 22</a>] and it has been inscribed in the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore in the given circle the square <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> has been inscribed. Q. E. F.</p>
