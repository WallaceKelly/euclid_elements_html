       <span class="perseus-ital">The square on the straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole, if applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth a fifth apotome.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be the straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole, and <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> a rational straight line, and to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> let <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span> be applied equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> and producing <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> as breadth; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> is a fifth apotome. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span> be the annex to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial but twice the rectangle contained by them rational. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop77">X. 77</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">To <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> let there be applied <span class="perseus-ital">CH</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GB</span>; therefore the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CL</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GB</span> together is medial; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CL</span> is medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, producing <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span> is rational and incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop22">X. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CL</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GB</span>, and, in these, <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, therefore the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">FL</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book02prop07">II. 7</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let then <span class="perseus-ital">FM</span> be bisected at <span class="perseus-ital">N</span>, and through <span class="perseus-ital">N</span> let <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> be drawn parallel to either of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ML</span>; therefore each of the rectangles <span class="perseus-ital">FO</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NL</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GB</span>: </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GB</span> is rational and equal to <span class="perseus-ital">FL</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FL</span> is rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, producing <span class="perseus-ital">FM</span> as breadth; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FM</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop20">X. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">CL</span> is medial, and <span class="perseus-ital">FL</span> rational, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CL</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">FL</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-ital">CL</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">FL</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And both are rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> is an apotome. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop73">X. 73</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that it is also a fifth apotome. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For we can prove similarly that the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">CK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">NM</span>, that is, to the fourth part of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FM</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is incommensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GB</span>, while the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">CH</span>, and the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GB</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CH</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-ital">CH</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">CK</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CK</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span> are two unequal straight lines, and a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FM</span> and deficient by a square figure has been applied to <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span>, and divides it into incommensurable parts, therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">CM</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop18">X. 18</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the annex <span class="perseus-ital">FM</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> set out; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> is a fifth apotome.
