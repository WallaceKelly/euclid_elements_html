      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> be two unequal straight lines, of which <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is the greater, and let there be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, that is, equal to the square on the half of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, and deficient by a square figure. Let this be the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span>, [cf. Lemma]  and let <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> be commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span>; I say that the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> be bisected at the point <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> has been cut into equal parts at <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, and into unequal parts at <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, therefore the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span>, together with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span>, is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book02prop05">II. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the same is true of their quadruples; therefore four times the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span>, together with four times the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, is equal to four times the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is equal to four times the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span>; and the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> is equal to four times the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, for <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> is double of <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is equal to four times the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span>, for again <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is double of <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> are equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, so that the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is to be proved that <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>, for <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop12">X. 12</a>] so that <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is also commensurable in length with the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop15">X. 15</a>] therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, let the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> be greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, let a parallelogram be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> equal to the fourth part of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is to be proved that <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">With the same construction, we can prove similarly that the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is also commensurable in length with the remainder, the sum of <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span>.
