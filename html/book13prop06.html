      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">If a rational straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">each of the segments is the irrational straight line called apotome.</span>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be a rational straight line, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> be the greater segment; I say that each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is the irrational straight line called apotome. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> be produced, and let <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> be made half of <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and to the greater segment <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is added <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> which is half of <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is five times the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book13prop01">XIII. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> has to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span> the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span> is rational, for <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span> is rational, being half of <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> which is rational; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is also rational; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def04">X. Def. 4</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is also rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> has not to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is an apotome. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop73">X. 73</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the greater segment, therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06def03">VI. Def. 3</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop17">VI. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the square on the apotome <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, if applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, produces <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> as breadth. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on an apotome, if applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth a first apotome; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop97">X. 97</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is a first apotome. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span> was also proved to be an apotome. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
