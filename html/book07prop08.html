       <span class="perseus-ital">If a number be the same parts of a number that a number subtracted is of a number subtracted, the remainder will also be the same parts of the remainder that the whole is of the whole.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the number <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be the same parts of the number <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> that <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> subtracted is of <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> subtracted; I say that the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is also the same parts of the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> that the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is of the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, whatever parts <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> is of <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, the same parts also is <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> be divided into the parts of <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, namely <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KH</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> into the parts of <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, namely <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">LE</span>; thus the multitude of <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KH</span> will be equal to the multitude of <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">LE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now since, whatever part <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span> is of <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, the same part also is <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, while. <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">GM</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, whatever part <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span> is of <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, the same part also is <span class="perseus-ital">GM</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>; therefore also the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">MK</span> is the same part of the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> that the whole <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span> is of the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop07">VII. 7</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since, whatever part <span class="perseus-ital">KH</span> is of <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, the same part also is <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">KN</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, whatever part <span class="perseus-ital">KH</span> is of <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, the same part also is <span class="perseus-ital">KN</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>; therefore also the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">NH</span> is the same part of the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> that the whole <span class="perseus-ital">KH</span> is of the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop07">VII. 7</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">MK</span> was also proved to be the same part of the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> that the whole <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span> is of the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>; therefore also the sum of <span class="perseus-ital">MK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NH</span> is the same parts of <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> that the whole <span class="perseus-ital">HG</span> is of the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the sum of <span class="perseus-ital">MK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NH</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">HG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>; therefore the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is the same parts of the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> that the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is of the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>.
