      <p class="perseus-p">But the side of the pentagon is the side of the icosahedron; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book13prop16">XIII. 16</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MB</span> belongs to the icosahedron. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span> is a side of the cube, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="perseus-ital">N</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">NB</span> be the greater segment; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">NB</span> is a side of the dodecahedron.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the square on the side of the pyramid is fourthirds of the square on the side of the octahedron, and double of the square on the side of the cube; and the square on the side of the octahedron is one and a half times the square on the side of the cube. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">The said sides, therefore, of the three figures, I mean the pyramid, the octahedron and the cube, are to one another in rational ratios. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">That the side <span class="perseus-ital">MB</span> of the icosahedron is greater than the side <span class="perseus-ital">NB</span> of the dodecahedron we can prove thus. </p>
