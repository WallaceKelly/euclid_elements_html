      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If a straight line touch a circle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">and from the point of contact a straight line be drawn at right angles to the tangent</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">the centre of the circle will be on the straight line so drawn</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> touch the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> at the point <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, and from <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> let <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> be drawn at right angles to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>; I say that the centre of the circle is on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For suppose it is not, but, if  possible, let <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> be the centre, and let <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> touches the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> has been joined from the centre to the point of contact, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> is perpendicular to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop18">III. 18</a>] therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FCE</span> is right.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACE</span> is also right; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FCE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACE</span>, the less to the greater: which is impossible.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> is not the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except a point on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
