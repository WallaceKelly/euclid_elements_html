      <p class="perseus-p">For let the area <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> and the fourth apotome <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>; I say that the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is minor. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> be the annex to <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GD</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> set out, and the square on the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is greater than the square on the annex <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def03">X.

      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GD</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, therefore, if there be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> and deficient by a square figure, it will divide it into incommensurable parts. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop18">X. 18</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let then <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> be bisected at <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, let there be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> a parallelogram equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FI</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span> be drawn through <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> parallel to <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, therefore the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span> is rational. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop19">X. 19</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, and both are rational, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AI</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now let the square <span class="perseus-ital">LM</span> be constructed equal to <span class="perseus-ital">AI</span>, and let there be subtracted <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> equal to <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span> and about the same angle, the angle <span class="perseus-ital">LPM</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the squares <span class="perseus-ital">LM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> are about the same diameter. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop26">VI. 26</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">PR</span> be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, therefore, proportionally, as <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop17">VI. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">AI</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, and, as <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span> is a mean proportional between <span class="perseus-ital">AI</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> is also a mean proportional between the squares <span class="perseus-ital">LM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">AI</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">LM</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">DH</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">LO</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>; therefore the whole <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is equal to the gnomon <span class="perseus-ital">UVW</span> and <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span> is equal to the squares <span class="perseus-ital">LM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>, and, in these, <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is equal to the gnomon <span class="perseus-ital">UVW</span> and the square <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>, therefore the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">ST</span>, that is, to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">LN</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">LN</span> is the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that <span class="perseus-ital">LN</span> is the irrational straight line called minor. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span> is rational and is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">LP</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">PN</span>, therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">LP</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">PN</span> is rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is medial, and <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">LP</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">PN</span>, therefore twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">LP</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">PN</span> is medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AI</span> was proved incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span>, therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">LP</span> is also incommensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">PN</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">LP</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">PN</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but twice the rectangle contained by them medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">LN</span> is the irrational straight line called minor; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop76">X. 76</a>] and it is the “side”

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the “side”
