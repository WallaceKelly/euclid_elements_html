      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">In acute-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the acute angle is less than the squares on the sides containing the acute angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides about the acute angle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">namely that on which the perpendicular falls</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">and the straight line cut off within by the perpendicular towards the acutc angle</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be an acute-angled triangle having the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> acute, and let <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> be drawn from the point <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> perpendicular to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>;</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is less than the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> by twice the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> has been cut at random at <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> are equal to twice the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> and the square on <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>.

       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the square on <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> be added to each; therefore the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> are equal to twice the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> and the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>, for the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> is right; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop47">I. 47</a>] and the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>; therefore the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> are equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> and twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>,</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">so that the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> alone is less than the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> by twice the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>.</p>
