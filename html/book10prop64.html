      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be the side of a rational plus a medial area, divided into its straight lines at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the greater; let a rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> be set out, and let there be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, producing <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> as its breadth; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is a fifth binomial straight line. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the same construction as before be made. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is the side of a rational plus a medial area, divided at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop40">X. 40</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is medial, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DL</span> is medial, so that <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop22">X. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, that is <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span>, is rational, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> is rational and commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop20">X. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that it is also a fifth binomial straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For it can be proved similarly that the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, and that <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span>; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop18">X. 18</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> are commensurable in square only, and the less, <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span>, is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is a fifth binomial. Q. E. D.</p>
