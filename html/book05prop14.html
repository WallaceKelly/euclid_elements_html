      <p class="perseus-p">For let a first magnitude <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> have the same ratio to a second <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> as a third <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> has to a fourth <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>; and let <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> be greater than <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is another, chance, magnitude, therefore <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> a greater ratio than <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> has to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop08">V. 8</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> has also to <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> a greater ratio than <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> has to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop13">V. 13</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But that to which the same has a greater ratio is less; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop10">V. 10</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> is less than <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>; so that <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that, if <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> be equal to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> will also be equal to <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>; and, if <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> be less than <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> will also be less than <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. </p>
