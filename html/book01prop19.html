       <p class="perseus-p">Now <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is not equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>; for then the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> would also have been equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop05">I. 5</a>] but it is not;
