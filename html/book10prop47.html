      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be divided at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are incommensurable in square and make the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> medial, and the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> medial and also incommensurable with the sum of the squares on them; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is not divided at another point so as to fulfil the given conditions. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let it be divided at <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so that again <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is of course not the same as <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, but <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is supposed greater; let a rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> be set out, and let there be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, and the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> equal to twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>; therefore the whole <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book02prop04">II. 4</a>
] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, let <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span>, equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>, be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>; therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>, is equal to the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">MK</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And since, by hypothesis, the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is medial, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> is also medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">HE</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop22">X. 22</a>
] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason <span class="perseus-ital">HN</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">GN</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">HN</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>
, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>
] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And they are rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HN</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span> is a binomial straight line divided at <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>
] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that it is also divided at <span class="perseus-ital">M.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span> is not the same with <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>; therefore a binomial has been divided at different points: which is absurd. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop42">X. 42</a>
] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore a side of the sum of two medial areas is not divided at different points; therefore it is divided at one point only.</p>
