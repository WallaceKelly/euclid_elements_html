      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> be three numbers in continued proportion, and let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> the first be square; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> the third is also square. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> there is one mean proportional number, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> are similar plane numbers. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book08prop20">VIII. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is square; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is also square. Q. E. D.</p>
