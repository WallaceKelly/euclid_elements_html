       <span class="perseus-ital">Straight lines which are parallel to the same straight line and are not in the same plane with it are also parallel to one another.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> be parallel to <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, not being in the same plane with it; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is parallel to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let a point <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> be taken at random on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, and from it let there be drawn <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>, in the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span> in the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> again at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop04">XI. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is parallel to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">HG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop08">XI. 8</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">HG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span>; therefore each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is at right angles to the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">HG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But if two straight lines be at right angles to the same plane, the straight lines are parallel; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop06">XI. 6</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is parallel to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>.</p>
