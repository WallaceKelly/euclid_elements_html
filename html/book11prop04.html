       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let a straight line <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> be set up at right angles to the two straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, which cut one another at the point <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, from <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> be cut off equal to one another, and let any straight line <span class="perseus-ital">GEH</span> be drawn across through <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, at random; let <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> be joined, and further let <span class="perseus-ital">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span> be joined from the point <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> taken at random &lt;on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>&gt;. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the two straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> are equal to the two straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, and contain equal angles, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop15">I. 15</a>] therefore the base <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, and the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">AED</span> will be equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">CEB</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>] so that the angle <span class="perseus-ital">DAE</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">EBC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-ital">AEG</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">BEH</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop15">I. 15</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AGE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BEH</span> are two triangles which have two angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely that adjacent to the equal angles, that is to say, <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop26">I. 26</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">BH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <span class="perseus-ital">FA</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason <span class="perseus-ital">FC</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">FA</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>, the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> respectively; and the base <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> was proved equal to the base <span class="perseus-ital">FC</span>; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">FAD</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">FBC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop08">I. 8</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And since, again, <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> was proved equal to <span class="perseus-ital">BH</span>, and further <span class="perseus-ital">FA</span> also equal to <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>, the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the angle <span class="perseus-ital">FAG</span> was proved equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">FBH</span>; therefore the base <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-ital">FH</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now since, again, <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span> was proved equal to <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is common, the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">HE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>; and the base <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-ital">FH</span>; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">GEF</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">HEF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop08">I. 8</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore each of the angles <span class="perseus-ital">GEF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HEF</span> is right. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> is at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> drawn at random through <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But a straight line is at right angles to a plane when it makes right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in that same plane; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11def03">XI. Def. 3</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the plane of reference is the plane through the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> is at right angles to the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
