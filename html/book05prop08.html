      <p class="perseus-p">First, let <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> be less than <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>; let <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> be multiplied, and let <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> be a multiple of it which is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>; then, whatever multiple <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, let <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> be made the same multiple of <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> and <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> of <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>; and let <span class="perseus-emph">L</span> be taken double of <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">M</span> triple of it, and successive multiples increasing by one, until what is taken is a multiple of <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> and the first that is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">K</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> is less than <span class="perseus-emph">N</span> first, therefore <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> is not less than <span class="perseus-emph">M</span>. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">I say next, that <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> also has to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> a greater ratio than <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> has to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that <span class="perseus-emph">N</span> is in excess of <span class="perseus-emph">K</span>, while <span class="perseus-emph">N</span> is not in excess of <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span>. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">[<span class="perseus-title">Case</span> 2.] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, let <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> be greater than <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then the less, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>, if multiplied, will sometime be greater than <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05def04">V. Def. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be multiplied, and let <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> be a multiple of <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> and greater than <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>; and, whatever multiple <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>, let <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> be made the same multiple of <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">K</span>

      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>; therefore the whole <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span> is in excess of <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">M</span>, that is, of <span class="perseus-emph">N</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> is not in excess of <span class="perseus-emph">N</span>, inasmuch as <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> also, which is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span>, that is, than <span class="perseus-emph">K</span>, is not in excess of <span class="perseus-emph">N</span>. </p>
