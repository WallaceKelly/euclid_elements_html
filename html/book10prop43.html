      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be a first bimedial straight line divided at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle;  I say that <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is not so divided at another point. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let it be divided at <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> also, so that <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> are also medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, that by which twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> differs from twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is that by which the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> differ from the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>, while twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> differs from twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> by a rational area—for both are rational— therefore the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> also differ from the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> by a rational area, though they are medial: which is absurd.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore a first bimedial straight line is not divided into its terms at different points; therefore it is so divided at one point only.</p>
