      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If a straight line be drawn parallel to one of the sides of a triangle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">it will cut the sides of the triangle proportionally; and</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">if the sides of the triangle be cut proportionally</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">the line joining the points of section will be parallel to the remaining side of the triangle</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> be drawn parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, one of the sides of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>; I say that, as <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BDE</span> is equal to  the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span>; for they are on the same base <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> and in the same parallels <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop38">I. 38</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span> is another area. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But equals have the same ratio to the same; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop07">V. 7</a>] therefore, as the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BDE</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BDE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>; for, being under the same height, the perpendicular drawn from <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, they are to one another as their bases. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason also, as the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, let the sides <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be cut proportionally, so that, as <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>; and let <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> is parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, with the same construction, since, as <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>, but, as <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BDE</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>, and, as <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] therefore also, <div class="perseus-center">as the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BDE</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore each of the triangles <span class="perseus-emph">BDE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span> has the same ratio to <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">BDE</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">CDE</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop09">V. 9</a>] and they are on the same base <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But equal triangles which are on the same base are also in the same parallels. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop39">I. 39</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span> is parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>. </p>
