       <span class="perseus-ital">A part of a straight line cannot be in the plane of reference and a part in a plane more elevated.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let a part <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> of the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> be in the plane of reference, and a part <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> in a plane more elevated. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">There will then be in the plane of reference some straight line continuous with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> in a straight line. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is a common segment of the two straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span>: which is impossible, inasmuch as, if we describe a circle with centre <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> and distance <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, the diameters will cut off unequal circumferences of the circle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore a part of a straight line cannot be in the plane of reference, and a part in a plane more elevated. Q. E. D.
