      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> be two parallel straight lines, and let one of them, <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, be at right angles to the plane of reference; I say that the remaining one, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, will also be at right angles to the same plane. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> meet the plane of reference at the points <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> be joined; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> are in one plane. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop07">XI. 7</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> be drawn, in the plane of reference, at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, let <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is also at right angles to all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11def03">XI. Def. 3</a>] therefore each of the angles <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ABE</span> is right. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> has fallen on the parallels <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, therefore the angles <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CDB</span> are equal to two right angles. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop29">I. 29</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span> is right; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">CDB</span> is also right; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> is common, the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>; and the angle <span class="perseus-ital">ABD</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">EDB</span>, for each is right; therefore the base <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span> respectively, and <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is their common base; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">ABE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">EDA</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-ital">ABE</span> is right; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">EDA</span> is also right; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it is also at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop04">XI. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> is in the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span>, inasmuch as <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> are in the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop02">XI. 2</a>] and <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> is also in the plane in which <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> are. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is also at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is also at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is set up at right angles to the two straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> which cut one another, from the point of section at <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; so that <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is also at right angles to the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop04">XI. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the plane through <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> is the plane of reference; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>
