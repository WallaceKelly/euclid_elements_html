      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If in a circle a straight line through the centre bisect a straight line not through the centre</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">it also cuts it at right angles; and if it cut it at right angles</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">it also bisects it</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be a circle, and in it let a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>
       through the centre bisect a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> not through the centre at the point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>;  I say that it also cuts it at right angles. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>
       be taken, and let it be <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>; let <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> is common, <div class="perseus-center">two sides are equal to two sides;</div>
       <div class="perseus-center">and the base <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AFE</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BFE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop08">I. 8</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01def10">I. Def. 10</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore each of the angles <span class="perseus-emph">AFE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BFE</span> is right.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, which is through the centre, and bisects <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> which is not through the centre, also cuts it at right angles. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, let <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> cut <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> at right angles; I say that it also bisects it. that is, that <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, with the same construction, <div class="perseus-center">since <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>,</div> the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EAF</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EBF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop05">I. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the right angle <span class="perseus-emph">AFE</span> is equal to the right angle <span class="perseus-emph">BFE</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-emph">EAF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EBF</span> are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, which is common to them, and subtends one of the equal angles; <div class="perseus-center">therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop26">I. 26</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FB</span>.</div>
