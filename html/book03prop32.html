      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If a straight line touch a circle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">and from the point of contact there be drawn across</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">in the circle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">a straight line cutting the circle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">the angles which it makes with the tangent will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> touch the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> at the point <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, and from the point <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> let there be drawn across, in the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>, a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> cutting it; I say that the angles which <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> makes with the tangent <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle, that is, that the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FBD</span> is equal to the angle constructed in the segment <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EBD</span> is equal to the angle constructed in the segment <span class="perseus-emph">DCB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> be drawn from <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> at right angles to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, let a point <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> be taken at random on the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>,  and let <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> touches the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> at <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> has been drawn from the point of contact at right angles to the tangent, the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> is on <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop19">III. 19</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> is a diameter of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ADB</span>, being an angle in a semicircle, is right. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop31">III. 31</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the remaining angles <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span> are equal to one right angle. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop32">I. 32</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABF</span> is also right; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABF</span> is equal to the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span> be subtracted from each; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DBF</span> which remains is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> in the alternate segment of the circle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, since <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> is a quadrilateral in a circle, its opposite angles are equal to two right angles. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop22">III. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angles <span class="perseus-emph">DBF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DBE</span> are also equal to two right angles; therefore the angles <span class="perseus-emph">DBF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DBE</span> are equal to the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span>, <div class="perseus-center">of which the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> was proved equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DBF</span>; therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DBE</span> which remains is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DCB</span> in the alternate segment <span class="perseus-emph">DCB</span> of the circle.</div>
