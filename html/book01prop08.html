       <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span> be two triangles having the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> respectively, namely <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>; and let them have the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>; </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">I say that the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">For, if the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be applied to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>, and if the point <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> be placed on the point <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> and the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> on <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the point <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> will also coincide with <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, because <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>.</div>

       <p class="perseus-p">Then, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> coinciding with <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> will also coincide with <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>;</div>
        for, if the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> coincides with the base <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, and the sides <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> do not coincide with <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span> but fall beside them as <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span>, <div class="perseus-center">then, given two straight lines constructed on a straight line (from its extremities) and meeting in a point, there will have been constructed on the same straight line (from its extremities), and on the same side of it, two other straight lines meeting in another point and equal to the former two respectively, namely each to that which has the same extremity with it. But they cannot be so constructed. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop07">I. 7</a>]</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Therefore it is not possible that, if the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> be applied to the base <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, the sides <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> should not coincide with <span class="perseus-emph">ED</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DF</span>; <div class="perseus-center">they will therefore coincide,</div>
