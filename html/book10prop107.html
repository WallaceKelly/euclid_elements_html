      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole, and let <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> be commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is also a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole.

      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span> be the annex to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, and let the same construction be made; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, the rectangle contained by them medial, and further the sum of the squares on them incommensurable with the rectangle contained by them.

      <p class="perseus-p">Now, as was proved, <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> are commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> with the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, and the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> with the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> are also straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, the rectangle contained by them medial, and further the sum of the squares on them incommensurable with the rectangle contained by them. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop78">X. 78</a>]</p>
