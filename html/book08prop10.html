       <span class="perseus-ital">If numbers fall between each of two numbers and an unit in continued proportion, however many numbers fall between each of them and an unit in continued proportion, so many also will fall between the numbers themselves in continued proportion.</span>
       
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> and <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> respectively fall between the two numbers <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> and the unit <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> in continued proportion; I say that, as many numbers as have fallen between each of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> and the unit <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> in continued proportion, so many numbers will also fall between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> in continued proportion. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, and let the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">L</span> respectively. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since, as the unit <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, therefore the unit <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> the same number of times as <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the unit <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; therefore the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, therefore the unit <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> the same number of times as <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason also <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Further, since <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> by multiplying the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">L</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> respectively, therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">L</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But it was also proved that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">K</span> and <span class="perseus-ital">K</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">L</span>;</div> therefore also, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">K</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">L</span> and <span class="perseus-ital">L</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
