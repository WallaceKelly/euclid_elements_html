       <span class="perseus-ital">Between two similar plane numbers there is one mean proportional number; and the plane number has to the plane number the ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be two similar plane numbers, and let the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> be the sides of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since similar plane numbers are those which have their sides proportional, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def21">VII. Def. 21</a>] therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say then that between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> there is one mean proportional number, and <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio duplicate of that which <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, or <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, that is, of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now since, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, therefore, alternately, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop13">VII. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is plane, and <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are its sides, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason also <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now let <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>; therefore also, as <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it was also proved that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>;</div> therefore also, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are in continued proportion. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> there is one mean proportional number. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> also has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of that which <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> or <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are in continued proportion, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio duplicate of that which it has to <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05def09">V. Def. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, and so is <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> also has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio duplicate of that which <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> or <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>.
