      <p class="perseus-p">For let two straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> incommensurable in square, and fulfilling the given conditions [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop34">X. 34</a>

      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is medial, while twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is rational, therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>; so that the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is also incommensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is irrational. </p>
