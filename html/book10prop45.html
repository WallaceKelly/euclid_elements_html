      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let it be divided at <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> also, so that <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> are also incommensurable in square and make the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since that by which the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> differ from the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> is also that by which twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> differs from twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, while the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> exceed the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> by a rational area—for both are rational— therefore twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> also exceeds twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> by a rational area, though they are medial: which is impossible.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore a major straight line is not divided at different points; therefore it is only divided at one and the same point. Q. E. D.</p>
