      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">From a medial straight line there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none of them is the same as any of the preceding</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be a medial straight line; I say that from <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none of them is the same as any of the preceding. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let a rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be set out,  and let the square on <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> be equal to the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is irrational; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def04">X. Def. 4</a>] for that which is contained by an irrational and a rational straight line is irrational. [deduction from <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop20">X. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is not the same with any of the preceding; for the square on none of the preceding, if applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a medial straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, let the square on <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> be equal to the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is irrational. [deduction from <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop20">X. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is irrational; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def04">X. Def. 4</a>] and it is not the same with any of the preceding, for the square on none of the preceding, if applied to a rational straight line, produces <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> as breadth. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly, if this arrangement proceeds <span class="perseus-foreign-la">ad infinitum</span>, it is manifest that from the medial straight line there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none is the same with any of the preceding. Q. E. D.</p>
