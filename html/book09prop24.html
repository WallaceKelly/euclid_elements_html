      <p class="perseus-p">For from the even number <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> let the even number <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> be subtracted: I say that the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span> is even. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is even, it has a half part. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def06">VII. Def. 6</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> also has a half part; so that the remainder [<span class="perseus-ital">CA</span> also has a half part, and] <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is therefore even. Q. E. D.</p>
