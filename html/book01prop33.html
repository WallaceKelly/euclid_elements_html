       <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> be equal and parallel, and let the straight  lines <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> join them (at the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively); I say that <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> are also equal and parallel.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> be joined. </p>
