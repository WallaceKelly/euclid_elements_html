      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">Figures which are similar to the same rectilineal figure are also similar to one another</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let each of the rectilineal figures <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> be similar to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is also similar to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is similar to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, it is equiangular with it and has the sides about the equal angles proportional. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06def01">VI. Def. 1</a>] 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is similar to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, it is equiangular with it and has the sides about the equal angles proportional. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore each of the figures <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is equiangular with <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> and with <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> has the sides about the equal angles proportional; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is similar to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>.
