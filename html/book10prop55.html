       <span class="perseus-ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the second binomial, the “side”
 of the area is the irrational straight line which is called a first bimedial.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the area <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> and the second binomial <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>; I say that the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is a first bimedial straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is a second binomial straight line, let it be divided into its terms at <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is the greater term; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, and the lesser term <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 2</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> be bisected at <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, and let there be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> and deficient by a square figure; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop17">X. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Through <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> let <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FL</span> be drawn parallel to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, let the square <span class="perseus-ital">SN</span> be constructed equal to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">AH</span>, and the square <span class="perseus-ital">NQ</span> equal to <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span>, and let them be placed so that <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> is in a straight line with <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">RN</span> is also in a straight line with <span class="perseus-ital">NP</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the square <span class="perseus-ital">SQ</span> be completed. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is then manifest from what was proved before that <span class="perseus-ital">MR</span> is a mean proportional between <span class="perseus-ital">SN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NQ</span> and is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span>, and that <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is now to be proved that <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is a first bimedial straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is also commensurable with each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop15">X. 15</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span> are also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> and <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span> are pairs of rational straight lines commensurable in square only; so that each of the rectangles <span class="perseus-ital">AH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span> is medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Hence each of the squares <span class="perseus-ital">SN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NQ</span> is medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> are also medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AH</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>. <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] that is, <span class="perseus-ital">SN</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">NQ</span>, that is, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">ED</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] so that <span class="perseus-ital">AH</span> is also incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-ital">SN</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">MR</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-ital">PN</span> with <span class="perseus-ital">NR</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] that is, <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> were proved to be both medial and commensurable in square; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that they also contain a rational rectangle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is, by hypothesis, commensurable with each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop12">X. 12</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And each of them is rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EL</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-ital">MR</span> is rational, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop19">X. 19</a>] and <span class="perseus-ital">MR</span> is the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if two medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle be added together, the whole is irrational and is called a first bimedial straight line. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop37">X. 37</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is a first bimedial straight line. Q. E. D.
