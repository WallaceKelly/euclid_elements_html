      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be binomial, and let <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> be commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>;  I say that <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is binomial and the same in order with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is binomial, let it be divided into its terms at <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> be the greater term; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be contrived that, as <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop12">VI. 12</a>] therefore also the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is to the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> as <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop19">V. 19</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> with <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> are rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> are also rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, as <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, alternately, as <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop16">V. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> are commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> are also commensurable in square only. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And they are rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that it is the same in order with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> either by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">If then the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> will also be greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop14">X. 14</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, if <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> will also be commensurable with it, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop12">X. 12</a>] and for this reason each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is a first binomial, that is, the same in order. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> is also commensurable with it, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop12">X. 12</a>] and for this reason again <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> will be the same in order with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, for each of them will be a second binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 2</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if neither of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, neither of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> will be commensurable with it, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] and each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is a third binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 3</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> is also greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop14">X. 14</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, if <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> is also commensurable with it, and each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is a fourth binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is so commensurable, so is <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> also, and each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> will be a fifth binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if neither of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is so commensurable, neither of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, and each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> will be a sixth binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 6</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Hence a straight line commensurable in length with a binomial straight line is binomial and the same in order. Q. E. D.</p>
