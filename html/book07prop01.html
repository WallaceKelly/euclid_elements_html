       <span class="perseus-ital">Two unequal numbers being set out, and the less being continually subtracted in turn from the greater, if the number which is left never measures the one before it until an unit is left, the original numbers will be prime to one another.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, the less of two unequal numbers <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> being continually subtracted from the greater, let the number which is left never measure the one before it until an unit is left; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> are prime to one another, that is, that an unit alone measures <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> are not prime to one another, some number will measure them. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let a number measure them, and let it be <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; let <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, measuring <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>, leave <span class="perseus-ital">FA</span> less than itself, let <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, measuring <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span>, leave <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span> less than itself, and let <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span>, measuring <span class="perseus-ital">FH</span>, leave an unit <span class="perseus-ital">HA</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it also measures the whole <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>; therefore it will also measure the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it also measures the whole <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> therefore it will also measure the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">CG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">CG</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">FH</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">FH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it also measures the whole <span class="perseus-ital">FA</span>; therefore it will also measure the remainder, the unit <span class="perseus-ital">AH</span>, though it is a number: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore no number will measure the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> are prime to one another.
