      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">To construct a cube and comprehend it in a sphere</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">like the pyramid; and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere is triple of the square on the side of the cube.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the diameter <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> of the given sphere be set out, and let it be cut at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> so that <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is double of <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>; let the semicircle <span class="perseus-ital">ADB</span> be described on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, let <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> be drawn from <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> be joined; let the square <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span> having its side equal to <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> be set out, from <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> let <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FL</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HN</span> be drawn at right angles to the plane of the square <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, from <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FL</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HN</span> let <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FL</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HN</span> respectively be cut off equal to one of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HE</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">LM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NK</span> be joined; therefore the cube <span class="perseus-ital">FN</span> has been constructed which is contained by six equal squares. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is then required to comprehend it in the given sphere, and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere is triple of the square on the side of the cube. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">KG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since the angle <span class="perseus-ital">KEG</span> is right, because <span class="perseus-ital">KE</span> is also at right angles to the plane <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> and of course to the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> also, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11def03">XI. Def. 3</a>] therefore the semicircle described on <span class="perseus-ital">KG</span> will also pass through the point <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span> is at right angles to each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">FL</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span> is also at right angles to the plane <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span>; hence also, if we join <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span> will be at right angles to <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span>; and for this reason again the semicircle described on <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span> will also pass through <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly it will also pass through the remaining angular points of the cube. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">If then, <span class="perseus-ital">KG</span> remaining fixed, the semicircle be carried round and restored to the same position from which it began to be moved, the cube will be comprehended in a sphere. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that it is also comprehended in the given sphere. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>, and the angle at <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> is right, therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> is double of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> is double of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>; hence the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, that is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span> [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop47">I. 47</a>], is triple of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is triple of <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, while, as <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is triple of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span> was also proved triple of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">KE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">KE</span> was made equal to <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">KG</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is the diameter of the given sphere; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">KG</span> is also equal to the diameter of the given sphere. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the cube has been comprehended in the given sphere; and it has been demonstrated at the same time that the square on the diameter of the sphere is triple of the square on the side of the cube. Q. E. D.</p>
