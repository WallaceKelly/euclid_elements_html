      <p class="perseus-p">Let any rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> be set out, and let it be contrived that, as <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">HG</span> is rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">HG</span> is rational. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">It is next to be proved that it is also a sixth binomial straight line. </p>

       <p class="perseus-p">Let there be two squares <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, and let them be placed so that <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> is in a straight line with <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FB</span> is also in a straight line with <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span>. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Let the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> be completed; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is a square, that <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is a mean proportional between <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, and further that <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> is a mean proportional between <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>.

       <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">BF</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">BG</span>, therefore the whole <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is equal to the whole <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. </p>
