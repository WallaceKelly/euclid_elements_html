      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If two circles touch one another externally</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">the straight line joining their centres will pass through the point of contact</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the two circles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span> touch one another externally at the point <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, and let the centre <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> of <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, and the centre <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> of <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>, be taken; I say that the straight line joined from <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> will pass through the point of contact at <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it pass as <span class="perseus-emph">FCDG</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> be joined. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since the point <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> is the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since the point <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> is the centre of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ADE</span>, <div class="perseus-center"><span class="perseus-emph">GA</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> was also proved equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> are equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GD</span>, so that the whole <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>;</div> but it is also less [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop20">I. 20</a>]: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the straight line joined from <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">G</span> will not fail to pass through the point of contact at <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore it will pass through it.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
