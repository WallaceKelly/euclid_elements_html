      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">The square on the first bimedial straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the second binomial</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be a first bimedial straight line divided into its medials at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, of which medials <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the greater; let a rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> be set out, and let there be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, producing <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> as its breadth; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is a second binominal straight line. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the same construction as before be made. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is a first bimedial divided at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only, and containing a rational rectangle, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop37">X. 37</a>] so that the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are also medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DL</span> is medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop15">X. 15</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop23">X. 23, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it has been applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MD</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop22">X. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is rational, <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span> is also rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">ML</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> is also rational and commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">ML</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop20">X. 20</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And they are rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is next to be proved that it is also a second binomial straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are greater than twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DL</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DH</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop17">X. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> is commensurable is length with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is a second binomial straight line. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 2</a>]</p>
