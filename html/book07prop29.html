       <span class="perseus-ital">Any prime number is prime to any number which it does not measure.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be a prime number, and let it not measure <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> are prime to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> are not prime to one another, some number will measure them. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measure them. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> does not measure <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is not the same with <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, therefore it also measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> which is prime, though it is not the same with it: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore no number will measure <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are prime to one another. Q. E. D.</p>
