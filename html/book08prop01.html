      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be as many numbers as we please, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, in continued proportion, and let the extremes of them <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> be prime to one another; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are the least of those which have the same ratio with them.

      <p class="perseus-p">For, if not, let <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> be less than <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, and in the same ratio with them. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are in the same ratio with <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, and the multitude of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is equal to the multitude of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, therefore, <span class="perseus-ital">ex aequali</span>, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>.

      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are prime, primes are also least, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop21">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop20">VII. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> which are less than <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are not in the same ratio with them. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are the least of those which have the same ratio with them. Q. E. D.</p>
