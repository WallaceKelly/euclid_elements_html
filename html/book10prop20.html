      <p class="perseus-p">For let the rational area <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, a straight line once more rational in any of the aforesaid ways, producing <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> as breadth; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>. For on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> let the square <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> be described; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span> is rational.

      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is also rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, as <span class="perseus-ital">DA</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] and <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is also rational and commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. </p>
