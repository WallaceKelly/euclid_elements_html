      <p class="perseus-p">Let any number of magnitudes whatever <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> be respectively equimultiples of any magnitudes <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span> equal in multitude; I say that, whatever multiple <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, that multiple will <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> also be of <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is the same multiple of <span class="perseus-emph">E</span> that <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, as many magnitudes as there are in <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, so many also are there in <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be divided into the magnitudes <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GB</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> into <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">HD</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; then the multitude of the magnitudes <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GB</span> will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">HD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason </p>
      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">GB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">GB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">HD</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, so many also are there in <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>; therefore, whatever multiple <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, that multiple will <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> also be of <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>. </p>
