      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span> be triangles and <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> parallelograms under the same height; I say that, as the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span>, and the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> be produced in both directions to the points <span class="perseus-emph">H</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">L</span> and let [any number of straight lines] <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> be made equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, and any number of straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">DK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">KL</span> equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>; let <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AH</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AL</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> are equal to one another, <div class="perseus-center">the triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AGB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AHG</span> are also equal to one another.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, whatever multiple the base <span class="perseus-emph">HC</span> is of the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, that multiple also is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">AHC</span> of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason, whatever multiple the base <span class="perseus-emph">LC</span> is of the base <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, that multiple also is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ALC</span> of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span>; and, if the base <span class="perseus-emph">HC</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">CL</span>, the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">AHC</span> is also equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ACL</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop38">I. 38</a>] if the base <span class="perseus-emph">HC</span> is in excess of the base <span class="perseus-emph">CL</span>, the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">AHC</span>
       is also in excess of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ACL</span>, and, if less, less. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Thus, there being four magnitudes, two bases <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> and two triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span>, equimultiples have been taken of the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> and the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, namely the base <span class="perseus-emph">HC</span> and the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">AHC</span>, and of the base <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> and the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> other, chance, equimultiples, namely the base <span class="perseus-emph">LC</span> and the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ALC</span>; <div class="perseus-center">and it has been proved that,</div> if the base <span class="perseus-emph">HC</span> is in excess of the base <span class="perseus-emph">CL</span>, the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">AHC</span>
       is also in excess of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ALC</span>; if equal, equal; and, if less, less. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05def05">V. Def. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, since the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> is double of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop41">I. 41</a>] and the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span> is double of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span>, while parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop15">V. 15</a>] therefore, as the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span>, so is the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, it was proved that, as the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span>, and, as the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span>, so is the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, therefore also, as the base <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, so is the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">FC</span>.
