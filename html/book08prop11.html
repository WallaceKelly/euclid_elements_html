       <span class="perseus-ital">Between two square numbers there is one mean proportional number, and the square has to the square the ratio duplicate of that which the side has to the side.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be square numbers, and let <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> be the side of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>; I say that between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> there is one mean proportional number, and <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio duplicate of that which <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is a square and <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is its side, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason also <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> by multiplying the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> respectively, therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason also, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop18">VII. 18</a>]</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> there is one mean proportional number. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> also has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio duplicate of that which <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are three numbers in proportion, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio duplicate of that which <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05def09">V. Def. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio duplicate of that which the side <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
