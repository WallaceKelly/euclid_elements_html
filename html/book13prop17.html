      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">BU</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">UV</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-ital">BW</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">WC</span>, and the base <span class="perseus-ital">BV</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, therefore the angle <span class="perseus-ital">BUV</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">BWC</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that the angle <span class="perseus-ital">UVC</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-ital">BWC</span>; therefore the three angles <span class="perseus-ital">BWC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BUV</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">UVC</span> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But if in an equilateral pentagon three angles are equal to one another, the pentagon will be equiangular, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book13prop07">XIII. 7</a>] therefore the pentagon <span class="perseus-ital">BUVCW</span> is equiangular. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it was also proved equilateral; therefore the pentagon <span class="perseus-ital">BUVCW</span> is equilateral and equiangular, and it is on one side <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> of the cube. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, if we make the same construction in the case of each of the twelve sides of the cube, a solid figure will have been constructed which is contained by twelve equilateral and equiangular pentagons, and which is called a dodecahedron. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is then required to comprehend it in the given sphere, and to prove that the side of the dodecahedron is the irrational straight line called apotome. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">XP</span> be produced, and let the produced straight line be <span class="perseus-ital">XZ</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">PZ</span> meets the diameter of the cube, and they bisect one another, for this has been proved in the last theorem but one of the eleventh book.

      <p class="perseus-p">Let them cut at <span class="perseus-ital">Z</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">Z</span> is the centre of the sphere which comprehends the cube, and <span class="perseus-ital">ZP</span> is half of the side of the cube. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">UZ</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">NS</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="perseus-ital">P</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">NP</span> is its greater segment, therefore the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">NS</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">SP</span> are triple of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">NP</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book13prop04">XIII. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">NS</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">XZ</span>, inasmuch as <span class="perseus-ital">NP</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-ital">PZ</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">XP</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">PS</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But further <span class="perseus-ital">PS</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-ital">XU</span>, since it is also equal to <span class="perseus-ital">RP</span>; therefore the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">ZX</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">XU</span> are triple of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">NP</span>. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on the radius of the sphere which comprehends the cube is also triple of the square on the half of the side of the cube, for it has previously been shown how to construct a cube and comprehend it in a sphere, and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere is triple of the square on the side of the cube. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book13prop15">XIII. 15</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if whole is so related to whole, so is half to half also; and <span class="perseus-ital">NP</span> is half of the side of the cube; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">UZ</span> is equal to the radius of the sphere which comprehends the cube. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that each of the remaining angles of the dodecahedron is also on the surface of the sphere; therefore the dodecahedron has been comprehended in the given sphere. </p>
