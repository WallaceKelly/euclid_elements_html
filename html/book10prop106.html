      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole, and <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is also a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.

      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span> be the annex to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational.

      <p class="perseus-p">Let the same construction be made. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then we can prove, in manner similar to the foregoing, that <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> are in the same ratio as <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is commensurable with the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, and the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> with the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>; so that <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> are also straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop77">X. 77</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
