      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be a rational straight line, let <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> be a binomial, and let <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> be its greater term; let the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> be equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>;  I say that <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is an apotome the terms of which are commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>, and in the same ratio, and further <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> will have the same order as <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For again let the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> be equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">But, as <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">KE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] therefore also, as <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">KF</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>] therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> is also commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">KF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop22">VI. 22</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, as the square on <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> is to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">KF</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">KE</span>, since the three straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">HK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KE</span> are proportional.

      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, while the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is rational, therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> is also rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EH</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop20">X. 20</a>] so that <span class="perseus-ital">EK</span>, being commensurable with it, is also rational and commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, as <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">KE</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> are straight lines commensurable in square only, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KE</span> are also commensurable in square only.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KE</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is an apotome. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop73">X. 73</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> either by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. </p>
