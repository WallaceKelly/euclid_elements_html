       <span class="perseus-ital">Given two numbers, to find the least number which they measure.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be the two given numbers; thus it is required to find the least number which they measure. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are either prime to one another or not. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">First, let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be prime to one another, and let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>; therefore also <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> measure <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that it is also the least number they measure. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if not, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> will measure some number which is less than <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let them measure <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, as many times as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, and, as many times as <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so many units let there be in <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def15">VII.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>

      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are prime, primes are also least, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop21">VII. 21</a>] and the least measure the numbers which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, as consequent consequent. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> do not measure any number less than <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is the least that is measured by <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> not be prime to one another, and let <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, be taken; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop33">VII. 33</a>] therefore the product of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is equal to the product of <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
