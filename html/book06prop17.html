      <p class="perseus-p">Let the three straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> be proportional, so that, as <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>; I say that the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since, as <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if four straight lines be proportional, the rectangle contained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle contained by the means. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop16">VI. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> is the square on <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, for <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>; therefore the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, let the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> be equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>; I say that, as <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, with the same construction, since the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, while the square on <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, for <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal to that contained by the means, the four straight lines are proportional. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop16">VI. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>. </p>
