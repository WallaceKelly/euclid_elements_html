      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">To a minor straight line only one straight line can be annexed which is incommensurable in square with the whole and which makes, with the whole, the sum of the squares on them rational but twice the rectangle contained by them medial</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be the minor straight line, and let <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> be an annex to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>;  therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but twice the rectangle contained by them medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop76">X. 76</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that no other straight line can be annexed to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> fulfilling the same conditions. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> be so annexed; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> are also straight lines incommensurable in square which fulfil the aforesaid conditions. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop76">X. 76</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the excess of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> over the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is also the excess of twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> over twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, while the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> exceed the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> by a rational area, for both are rational, therefore twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DB</span> also exceeds twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> by a rational area: which is impossible, for both are medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop26">X. 26</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore to a minor straight line only one straight line can be annexed which is incommensurable in square with the whole and which makes the squares on them added together rational, but twice the rectangle contained by them medial. Q. E. D.</p>
