      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">The square on the binomial straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the first binomial</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be a binomial straight line divided into its terms at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is the greater term; let a rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> be set out, and let <span class="perseus-ital">DEFG</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> producing <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> as its breadth; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is a first binomial straight line. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let there be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">DH</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>; therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> be bisected at <span class="perseus-ital">N</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> be drawn parallel [to <span class="perseus-ital">ML</span> or <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span>]. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore each of the rectangles <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NF</span> is equal to once the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is a binomial divided into its terms at <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>] therefore the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are rational and commensurable with one another, so that the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is also rational. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop15">X. 15</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">DL</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DL</span> is rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop20">X. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, therefore twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, that is <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span>, is medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it is applied to the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">ML</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> is also rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">ML</span>, that is, <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop22">X. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">MD</span> is also rational and is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And they are rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">It is next to be proved that it is also a first binomial straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is a mean proportional between the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, [cf. <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop53">Lemma after X. 53</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> is also a mean proportional between <span class="perseus-ital">DH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">DH</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">MO</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, that is, as <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">MK</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop17">VI. 17</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DH</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> are greater than twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop59">Lemma</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DL</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-ital">MF</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is also greater than <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span>, that is, to the fourth part of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">KM</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if it divide it into commensurable parts, the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with the greater; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop17">X. 17</a>] therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MG</span> are rational, and <span class="perseus-ital">DM</span>, which is the greater term, is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> set out. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is a first binomial straight line. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 1</a>] Q. E. D.</p>
