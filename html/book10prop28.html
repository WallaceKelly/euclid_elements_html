       <p class="perseus-p">For, if it is square, it is either equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, or less than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, but cannot any more be greater, lest the unit be divided. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">First, if possible, let the product of <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span> be equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">GA</span> be double of the unit <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span>. </p>
