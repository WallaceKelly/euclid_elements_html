      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If from a parallelogram there be taken away a parallelogram similar and similarly situated to the whole and having a common angle with it</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">it is about the same diameter with the whole</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For from the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> let there be taken away the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> similar and similarly situated to <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>, and having the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAB</span> common with it;  I say that <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> is about the same diameter with <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let <span class="perseus-emph">AHC</span> be the diameter &lt; of <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> &gt;, let <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> be produced and carried through to <span class="perseus-emph">H</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">HK</span> be drawn through <span class="perseus-emph">H</span> parallel to either of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop31">I. 31</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> is about the same diameter with <span class="perseus-emph">KG</span>, therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AK</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop24">VI. 24</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But also, because of the similarity of <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>;</div> therefore also, as <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AK</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span> has the same ratio to each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">AK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AK</span> [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop09">V. 9</a>], the less to the greater : which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> cannot but be about the same diameter with <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>; therefore the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> is about the same diameter with the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
