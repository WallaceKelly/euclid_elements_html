      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">To find the first binomial straight line</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let two numbers <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> be set out such that the sum of them <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, but has not to <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop28">Lemma I after X. 28</a>]  let any rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> be set out, and let <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> be commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is also rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be contrived that, as the number <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> also has to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> the ratio which a number has to a number, so that the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is also rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. neither, therefore, has the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> is binomial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop36">X. 36</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that it is also a first binomial straight line. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For since, as the number <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, while <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> is greater than <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is also greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let then the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> be equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now since, as <span class="perseus-ital">BA</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, therefore, <span class="perseus-ital">convertendo</span>, as <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop19">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> also has to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> are rational, and <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is a first binomial straight line. Q. E. D.</p>
