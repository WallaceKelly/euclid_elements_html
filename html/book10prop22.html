      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">The square on a medial straight line, if applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth a straight line rational and incommensurable in length with that to which it is applied</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be medial and <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> rational, and let a rectangular area <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, producing <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> as breadth; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is rational and incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is medial, the square on it is equal to a rectangular area contained by rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>] 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the square on it be equal to <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on it is also equal to <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it is also equiangular with it; and in equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop14">VI. 14</a>] therefore, proportionally, as <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop22">VI. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, for each of these straight lines is rational; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is also commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is also rational; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def04">X. Def. 4</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, for they are commensurable in square only, and, as <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, [Lemma] therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> is incommensurable with the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>.
