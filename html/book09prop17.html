       <span class="perseus-ital">If there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and the extremes of them be prime to one another, the last will not be to any other number as the first to the second.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let there be as many numbers as we please, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, in continued proportion, and let the extremes of them, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, be prime to one another; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is not to any other number as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so let <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> be to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; therefore, alternately, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop13">VII. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are prime, primes are also least, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop21">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop20">VII. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>; so that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And since, as <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> measured <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>; so that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it also measures itself; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> which are prime to one another : which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> will not be to any other number as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
