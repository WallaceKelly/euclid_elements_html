      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">If in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be drawn from the right angle to the base</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">the triangles adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole and to one another</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> be a right-angled triangle having the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> right, and let <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> be drawn from <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> perpendicular to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>; I say that each of the triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> is similar to the whole <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> and, further, they are similar to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ADB</span>, for each is right, and the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is common to the two triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> and <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>, therefore the remaining angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span> is equal to the remaining angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop32">I. 32</a>]  therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> which subtends the right angle in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> which subtends the right angle in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> itself which subtends the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> which subtends the equal angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>, and so also is <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> which subtends the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> common to the two triangles. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop04">VI. 4</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is both equiangular to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span> and has the sides about the equal angles proportional. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is similar to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06def01">VI. Def. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is also similar to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span>; therefore each of the triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> is similar to the whole <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that the triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> are also similar to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the right angle <span class="perseus-emph">BDA</span> is equal to the right angle <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span>, and moreover the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> was also proved equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, therefore the remaining angle at <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> is also equal to the remaining angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop32">I. 32</a>] therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> which subtends the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> which subtends the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> itself which subtends the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> which subtends the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span> in the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> equal to the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">B</span>, and so also is <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, these sides subtending the right angles; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop04">VI. 4</a>] therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span> is similar to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span>.
