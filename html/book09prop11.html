      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be as many numbers as we please, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, beginning from the unit <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> and in continued proportion; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, the least of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, measures <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> according to some one of the numbers <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But the unit <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> according to the units in it; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> also measures <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; so that <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the less measures <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> the greater according to some number of those which have place among the proportional numbers.— </p>
