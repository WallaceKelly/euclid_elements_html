      <p class="perseus-p">For let a point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> be taken outside the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, and from <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> let the two straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">DCA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span> fall on the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>; let <span class="perseus-emph">DCA</span> cut the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> and let <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span> touch it; I say that the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>.
