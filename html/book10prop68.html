      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">A straight line commensurable with a major straight line is itself also major</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be major, and let <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> be commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is major. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be divided at <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial.

      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the same construction be made as before. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then since, as <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, therefore also, as <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> are also commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> respectively. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop11">X. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And since, as <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, alternately also, as <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop16">V. 16</a>] therefore also, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">componendo</span>, as <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop18">V. 18</a>] therefore also, as the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop20">VI. 20</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that, as the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, so also is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> to the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>; therefore also, alternately, as the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so are the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> to the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop16">V. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>; therefore the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> are also commensurable with the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> together are rational; therefore the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> together are rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly also twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is commensurable with twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is medial; therefore twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> is also medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop23">X. 23, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make, at the same time, the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial; therefore the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is the irrational straight line called major. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop39">X. 39</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore a straight line commensurable with the major straight line is major. Q. E. D.</p>
