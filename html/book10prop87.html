      <p class="perseus-p">Let a rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be set out, let three numbers <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> be set out which have not to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, but let <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span> have to <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be contrived that, as <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, and, as <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then, as <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is also rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since, as <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>, therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is commensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop06">X. 6</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is rational; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> is also rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> is rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And both are rational; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FH</span> is an apotome. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop73">X. 73</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that it is also a third apotome. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For since, as <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, and, as <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">HG</span>, therefore, <span class="perseus-ital">ex aequali</span>, as <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">HG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop22">V. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> has not to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore neither of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> set out. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now let the square on <span class="perseus-ital">K</span> be that by which the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then, as <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>, therefore, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">convertendo</span>, as <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, so is the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop19">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> also has to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">K</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop09">X. 9</a>] and the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And neither of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> set out; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FH</span> is a third apotome. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def03">X. Deff. III. 3</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the third apotome <span class="perseus-ital">FH</span> has been found. Q. E. D.</p>
