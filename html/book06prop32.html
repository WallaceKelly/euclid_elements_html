      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DCE</span> be two triangles having the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> proportional to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, so that, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is in a straight line with <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>. </p>

      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DCE</span> are two triangles having one angle, the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, equal to one angle, the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, <div class="perseus-center">and the sides about the equal angles proportional,</div> so that, as <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">DE</span>, <div class="perseus-center">therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DCE</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop06">VI. 6</a>] therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DCE</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span> was also proved equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the whole angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACE</span> is equal to the two angles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span> be added to each; therefore the angles <span class="perseus-emph">ACE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span> are equal to the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CBA</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span> are equal to two right angles; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop32">I. 32</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angles <span class="perseus-emph">ACE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span> are also equal to two right angles.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore with a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, and at the point <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> on it, the two straight lines <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span> not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles <span class="perseus-emph">ACE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span> equal to two right angles; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is in a straight line with <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>.
