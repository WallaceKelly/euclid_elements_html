      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore in the triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GEF</span> the sides about the equal angles are proportional, and those are corresponding sides which subtend the equal angles; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop04">VI. 4</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore, as <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">GE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>.</div>

      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the angle <span class="perseus-emph">FED</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">GEF</span>, while the angle <span class="perseus-emph">GEF</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span>. </p>
