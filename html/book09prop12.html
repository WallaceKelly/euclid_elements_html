       <span class="perseus-ital">If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be in continued proportion, by however many prime numbers the last is measured, the next to the unit will also be measured by the same.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be as many numbers as we please, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, beginning from an unit, and in continued proportion; I say that, by however many prime numbers <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is measured, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> will also be measured by the same. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> be measured by any prime number <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For suppose it does not; now <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is prime, and any prime number is prime to any which it does not measure; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop29">VII. 29</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> are prime to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, let it measure it according to <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> according to the units in <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book09prop11">IX. 11</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book09prop11">IX. 11 Por.</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, further, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> has also by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> made <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; therefore the product of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is equal to the product of <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop19">VII. 19</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> are prime, primes are also least, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop21">VII. 21</a>] and the least measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it measure it according to <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, further, by the theorem before this, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has also by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> made <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book09prop11">IX. 11</a>, <a class="perseus-ref" href="book09prop11">IX. 11 Por.</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the product of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> is equal to the product of <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop19">VII. 19</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> are prime, primes are also least, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop21">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio with them the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent: [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it measure it according to <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But further <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has also by multiplying itself made <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book09prop08">IX. 8</a>] therefore the product of <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop19">VII. 19</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> are prime, primes are also least, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop21">VII. 21</a>] and the least measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07prop20">VII. 20</a>] therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, as antecedent antecedent. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, again, it also does not measure it: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> are not prime to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore they are composite to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But numbers composite to one another are measured by some number. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def14">VII. Def. 14</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> is by hypothesis prime, and the prime is not measured by any number other than itself, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, so that <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">[But it also measures <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> measures <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>.] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that, by however many prime numbers <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> is measured, <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> will also be measured by the same. Q. E. D.</p>
