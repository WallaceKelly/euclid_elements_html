      <p class="perseus-p">Let two spheres be conceived about the same centre <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>; thus it is required to inscribe in the greater sphere a polyhedral solid which does not touch the lesser sphere at its surface. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the spheres be cut by any plane through the centre; then the sections will be circles, inasmuch as the sphere was produced by the diameter remaining fixed and the semicircle being carried round it; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11def14">XI.

      <p class="perseus-p">And it is manifest that this circle is the greatest possible, inasmuch as the diameter of the sphere, which is of course the diameter both of the semicircle and of the circle, is greater than all the straight lines drawn across in the circle or the sphere. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let then <span class="perseus-ital">BCDE</span> be the circle in the greater sphere, and <span class="perseus-ital">FGH</span> the circle in the lesser sphere; let two diameters in them, <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>, be drawn at right angles to one another; then, given the two circles <span class="perseus-ital">BCDE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FGH</span> about the same centre, let there be inscribed in the greater circle <span class="perseus-ital">BCDE</span> an equilateral polygon with an even number of sides which does not touch the lesser circle <span class="perseus-ital">FGH</span>, let <span class="perseus-ital">BK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">LM</span>
       <span class="perseus-ital">ME</span> be its sides in the quadrant <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>. let <span class="perseus-ital">KA</span> be joined and carried through to <span class="perseus-ital">N</span>, let <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span> be set up from the point <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="perseus-ital">BCDE</span>, and let it meet the surface of the sphere at <span class="perseus-ital">O</span>, and through <span class="perseus-ital">AO</span> and each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KN</span> let planes be carried; they will then make greatest circles on the surface of the sphere, for the reason stated. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let them make such, and in them let <span class="perseus-ital">BOD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KON</span> be the semicircles on <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KN</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">OA</span> is at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="perseus-ital">BCDE</span>, therefore all the planes through <span class="perseus-ital">OA</span> are also at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="perseus-ital">BCDE</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop18">XI. 18</a>] hence the semicircles <span class="perseus-ital">BOD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KON</span> are also at right angles to the plane of the circle <span class="perseus-ital">BCDE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since the semicircles <span class="perseus-ital">BED</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BOD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KON</span> are equal, for they are on the equal diameters <span class="perseus-ital">BD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KN</span>, therefore the quadrants <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BO</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KO</span> are also equal to one another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore there are as many straight lines in the quadrants <span class="perseus-ital">BO</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KO</span> equal to the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">BK</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">LM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ME</span> as there are sides of the polygon in the quadrant <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>. </p>

[<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop07">XI. 7</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason each of the quadrilaterals <span class="perseus-ital">SPQT</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">TQRU</span> is also in one plane. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">I say that the said polyhedron will not touch the lesser sphere at the surface on which the circle <span class="perseus-ital">FGH</span> is. </p>
