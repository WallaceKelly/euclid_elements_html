       <span class="perseus-ital">Cones and cylinders which are of the same height are to one another as their bases.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be cones and cylinders of the same height, let the circles <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span> be their bases, <span class="perseus-ital">KL</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">MN</span> their axes and <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> the diameters of their bases; I say that, as the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so is the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> to the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if not, then, as the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so will the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> be either to some solid less than the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span> or to a greater. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">First, let it be in that ratio to a less solid <span class="perseus-ital">O</span>, and let the solid <span class="perseus-ital">X</span> be equal to that by which the solid <span class="perseus-ital">O</span> is less than the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span>; therefore the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span> is equal to the solids <span class="perseus-ital">O</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">X</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the square <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span> be inscribed in the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>; therefore the square is greater than the half of the circle. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be set up from the square <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span> a pyramid of equal height with the cone; therefore the pyramid so set up is greater than the half of the cone, inasmuch as, if we circumscribe a square about the circle, and set up from it a pyramid of equal height with the cone, the inscribed pyramid is half of the circumscribed pyramid, for they are to one another as their bases, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop06">XII. 6</a>] while the cone is less than the circumscribed pyramid. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the circumferences <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">HE</span> be bisected at the points <span class="perseus-ital">P</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">Q</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">R</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">S</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">HP</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">PE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EQ</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">QF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FR</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">RG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GS</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">SH</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore each of the triangles <span class="perseus-ital">HPE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EQF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FRG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GSH</span> is greater than the half of that segment of the circle which is about it. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">On each of the triangles <span class="perseus-ital">HPE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EQF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FRG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GSH</span> let there be set up a pyramid of equal height with the cone; therefore, also, each of the pyramids so set up is greater than the half of that segment of the cone which is about it. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Thus, bisecting the circumferences which are left, joining straight lines, setting up on each of the triangles pyramids of equal height with the cone, and doing this continually, we shall leave some segments of the cone which will be less than the solid <span class="perseus-ital">X</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop01">X. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let such be left, and let them be the segments on <span class="perseus-ital">HP</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">PE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EQ</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">QF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FR</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">RG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GS</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">SH</span>; therefore the remainder, the pyramid of which the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">HPEQFRGS</span> is the base and the height the same with that of the cone, is greater than the solid <span class="perseus-ital">O</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let there also be inscribed in the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">DTAUBVCW</span> similar and similarly situated to the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">HPEQFRGS</span>, and on it let a pyramid be set up of equal height with the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then, as the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, so is the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">DTAUBVCW</span> to the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">HPEQFRGS</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop01">XII. 1</a>] while, as the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> is to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span>, so is the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop02">XII. 2</a>] therefore also, as the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so is the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">DTAUBVCW</span> to the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">HPEQFRGS</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so is the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> to the solid <span class="perseus-ital">O</span>, and, as the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">DTAUBVCW</span> is to the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">HPEQFRGS</span>, so is the pyramid of which the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">DTAUBVCW</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">L</span> the vertex to the pyramid of which the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">HPEQFRGS</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">N</span> the vertex. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop06">XII. 6</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> is to the solid <span class="perseus-ital">O</span>, so is the pyramid of which the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">DTAUBVCW</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">L</span> the vertex to the pyramid of which the polygon <span class="perseus-ital">HPEQFRGS</span> is the base and the point <span class="perseus-ital">N</span> the vertex; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] therefore, alternately, as the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> is to the pyramid in it, so is the solid <span class="perseus-ital">O</span> to the pyramid in the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop16">V. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> is greater than the pyramid in it; therefore the solid <span class="perseus-ital">O</span> is also greater than the pyramid in the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it is also less: which is absurd. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> is not to any solid less than the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span> as the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly we can prove that neither is the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span> to any solid less than the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> as the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span> is to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that neither is the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> to any solid greater than the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span> as the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let it be in that ratio to a greater solid <span class="perseus-ital">O</span>; therefore, inversely, as the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span> is to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span>, so is the solid <span class="perseus-ital">O</span> to the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the solid <span class="perseus-ital">O</span> is to the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span>, so is the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span> to some solid less than the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span>; therefore also, as the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span> is to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span>, so is the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span> to some solid less than the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span>: which was proved impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> is not to any solid greater than the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span> as the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it was proved that neither is it in this ratio to a less solid; therefore, as the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so is the cone <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> to the cone <span class="perseus-ital">EN</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the cone is to the cone, so is the cylinder to the cylinder, for each is triple of each; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop10">XII. 10</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as the circle <span class="perseus-ital">ABCD</span> is to the circle <span class="perseus-ital">EFGH</span>, so are the cylinders on them which are of equal height. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
