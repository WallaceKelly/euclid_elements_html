      <p class="perseus-p">Let a first magnitude <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> be the same multiple of a second <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> that a third <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is of a fourth <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, and let equimultiples <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> be taken of <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> is the same multiple of <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> that <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> is the same multiple of <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> that <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, so many also are there in <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> be divided into the magnitudes <span class="perseus-emph">EK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">KF</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> into the magnitudes <span class="perseus-emph">GL</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">LH</span> equal to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>; then the multitude of the magnitudes <span class="perseus-emph">EK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">KF</span> will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes <span class="perseus-emph">GL</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">LH</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is the same multiple of <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> that <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, while <span class="perseus-emph">EK</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">A</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">GL</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">C</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-emph">EK</span> is the same multiple of <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> that <span class="perseus-emph">GL</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason </p>
      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">KF</span> is the same multiple of <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> that <span class="perseus-emph">LH</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, a first magnitude <span class="perseus-emph">EK</span> is the same multiple of a second <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> that a third <span class="perseus-emph">GL</span> is of a fourth <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, and a fifth <span class="perseus-emph">KF</span> is also the same multiple of the second <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> that a sixth <span class="perseus-emph">LH</span> is of the fourth <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>, therefore the sum of the first and fifth, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, is also the same multiple of the second <span class="perseus-emph">B</span> that the sum of the third and sixth, <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span>, is of the fourth <span class="perseus-emph">D</span>.
