      <p class="perseus-p">As the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so let <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> subtracted be to <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> subtracted; I say that the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is also to the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> as the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> to the whole <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, as <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, whatever part or parts <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is of <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span>, the same part or the same parts is <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span> also; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def20">VII.
