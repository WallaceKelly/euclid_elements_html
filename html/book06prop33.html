      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">In equal circles angles have the same ratio as the circumferences on which they stand</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DEF</span> be equal circles, and let the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EHF</span> be angles at their centres <span class="perseus-emph">G</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">H</span>, and the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span> angles at the circumferences; I say that, as the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, so is the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EHF</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let any number of consecutive circumferences <span class="perseus-emph">CK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">KL</span> be made equal to the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, and any number of consecutive circumferences <span class="perseus-emph">FM</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">MN</span> equal to the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>; and let <span class="perseus-emph">GK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">GL</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">HM</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">HN</span> be joined. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since the circumferences <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">KL</span> are equal to one another, the angles <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CGK</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">KGL</span> are also equal to one another; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop27">III. 27</a>] therefore, whatever multiple the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">BL</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, that multiple also is the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGL</span> of the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason also, whatever multiple the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">NE</span> is of <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, that multiple also is the angle <span class="perseus-emph">NHE</span> of the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EHF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">If then the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">BL</span> is equal to the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">EN</span>, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGL</span> is also equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EHN</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop27">III. 27</a>] if the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">BL</span> is greater than the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">EN</span>, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGL</span> is also greater than the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EHN</span>; and, if less, less. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">There being then four magnitudes, two circumferences <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, and two angles <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EHF</span>, there have been taken, of the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span> equimultiples, namely the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">BL</span> and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGL</span>, and of the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EHF</span> equimultiples, namely the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">EN</span> and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EHN</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And it has been proved that, if the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">BL</span> is in excess of the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">EN</span>, the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGL</span> is also in excess of the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EHN</span>; if equal, equal; and if less, less. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, as the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, so is the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EHF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05def05">V. Def. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span> is to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EHF</span>, so is the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>; for they are doubles respectively. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>, so is the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BGC</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EHF</span>, and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EDF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc. Q. E. D.</p>
