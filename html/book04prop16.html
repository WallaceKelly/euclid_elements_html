      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">In a given circle to inscribe a fifteen-angled figure which shall be both equilateral and equiangular</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> a fifteenangled figure which shall be both equilateral and equiangular. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">In the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> let there be inscribed a side <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> of the equilateral triangle inscribed in it, and a side <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> of an equilateral pentagon; therefore, of the equal segments of which there are fifteen in the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>, there will be five in the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> which is one-third of the circle, and there will be three in the circumference <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> which is one-fifth of the circle; <div class="perseus-center">therefore in the remainder <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> there will be two of the equal segments.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> be bisected at <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book03prop30">III. 30</a>] therefore each of the circumferences <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> is a fifteenth of the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">If therefore we join <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EC</span> and fit into the circle <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> straight lines equal to them and in contiguity, a fifteen-angled figure which is both equilateral and equiangular will have been inscribed in it. Q. E. F. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, in like manner as in the case of the pentagon, if through the points of division on the circle we draw tangents to the circle, there will be circumscribed about the circle a fifteen-angled figure which is equilateral and equiangular. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And further, by proofs similar to those in the case of the pentagon, we can both inscribe a circle in the given fifteenangled figure and circumscribe one about it. Q. E. F.</p>
