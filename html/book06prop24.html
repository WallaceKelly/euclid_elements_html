      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">In any parallelogram the parallelograms about the diameter are similar both to the whole and to one another</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> be a parallelogram, and <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> its diameter, and let <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">HK</span> be parallelograms about <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>; I say that each of the parallelograms <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">HK</span> is similar both to the whole <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> and to the other.

      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> has been drawn parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>, one of the sides of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <div class="perseus-center">proportionally, as <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span> has been drawn parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, one of the sides of the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span>, <div class="perseus-center">proportionally, as <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span>.

      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it was proved that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, so also is <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>; therefore also, as <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">GA</span>,</div> and therefore, <span class="perseus-emph">componendo</span>, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">DA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop18">V. 18</a>]</div> and, alternately, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span>.

      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore in the parallelograms <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>, the sides about the common angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAD</span> are proportional. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> is parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>, <div class="perseus-center">the angle <span class="perseus-emph">AFG</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DCA</span>;</div> and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">DAC</span> is common to the two triangles <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AGF</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ADC</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">AGF</span>.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason <div class="perseus-center">the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span> is also equiangular with the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">AFE</span>,</div> and the whole parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> is equiangular with the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, proportionally, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AG</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span>, as <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>, as <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span>,</div> and further, as <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">EA</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since it was proved that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span>,</div> and, as <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span>, therefore, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">ex aequali</span>, as <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">GF</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">FE</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop22">V. 22</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore in the parallelograms <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span> the sides about the equal angles are proportional; therefore the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> is similar to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06def01">VI. Def. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span> is also similar to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">KH</span>; therefore each of the parallelograms <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">HK</span> is similar to <span class="perseus-emph">ABCD</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But figures similar to the same rectilineal figure are also similar to one another; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop21">VI. 21</a>] therefore the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">EG</span> is also similar to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">HK</span>. </p>
