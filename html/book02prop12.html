      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-emph">In obtuse-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the obtuse angle is greater than the squares on the sides containing the obtuse angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides about the obtuse angle</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">namely that on which the</span>
