      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be the side of a rational plus a medial area, and let <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> be commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>; it is to be proved that <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is also the side of a rational plus a medial area. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be divided into its straight lines at <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational.

      <p class="perseus-p">Let the same construction be made as before. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">We can then prove similarly that <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> are incommensurable in square, and the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is commensurable with the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>, and the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> with the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span>; so that the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> is also medial, and the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FD</span> rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> is the side of a rational plus a medial area. Q. E. D.</p>
