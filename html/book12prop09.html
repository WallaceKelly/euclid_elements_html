       <span class="perseus-ital">In equal pyramids which have triangular bases the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; and those pyramids in which the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights are equal.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let there be equal pyramids which have the triangular bases <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> and vertices the points <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>; I say that in the pyramids <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so is the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> to the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the parallelepipedal solids <span class="perseus-ital">BGML</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EHQP</span> be completed. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> is equal to the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>, and the solid <span class="perseus-ital">BGML</span> is six times the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>, and the solid <span class="perseus-ital">EHQP</span> six times the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>, therefore the solid <span class="perseus-ital">BGML</span> is equal to the solid <span class="perseus-ital">EHQP</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But in equal parallelepipedal solids the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop34">XI. 34</a>] therefore, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">BM</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">EQ</span>, so is the height of the solid <span class="perseus-ital">EHQP</span> to the height of the solid <span class="perseus-ital">BGML</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">BM</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">EQ</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop34">I. 34</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so is the height of the solid <span class="perseus-ital">EHQP</span> to the height of the solid <span class="perseus-ital">BGML</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the height of the solid <span class="perseus-ital">EHQP</span> is the same with the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>, and the height of the solid <span class="perseus-ital">BGML</span> is the same with the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>, therefore, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so is the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> to the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore in the pyramids <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Next, in the pyramids <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> let the bases be reciprocally proportional to the heights; that is, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so let the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> be to the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>; I say that the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> is equal to the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, with the same construction, since, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so is the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> to the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>, while, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so is the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">BM</span> to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">EQ</span>, therefore also, as the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">BM</span> is to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">EQ</span>, so is the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> to the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> is the same with the height of the parallelepiped <span class="perseus-ital">EHQP</span>, and the height of the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> is the same with the height of the parallelepiped <span class="perseus-ital">BGML</span>; therefore, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">BM</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">EQ</span>, so is the height of the parallelepiped <span class="perseus-ital">EHQP</span> to the height of the parallelepiped <span class="perseus-ital">BGML</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But those parallelepipedal solids in which the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights are equal; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop34">XI. 34</a>] therefore the parallelepipedal solid <span class="perseus-ital">BGML</span> is equal to the parallelepipedal solid <span class="perseus-ital">EHQP</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> is a sixth part of <span class="perseus-ital">BGML</span>, and the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span> a sixth part of the parallelepiped <span class="perseus-ital">EHQP</span>; therefore the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> is equal to the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore etc Q. E. D.</p>
