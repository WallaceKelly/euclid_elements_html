       <p class="perseus-p">For let a point <span class="perseus-emph">D</span> be taken at random on the other side of the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, and with centre <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> and distance <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span> let the circle <span class="perseus-emph">EFG</span> be described; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01post03">Post. 3</a>]

       <p class="perseus-p">I say that <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span> has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> from the given point <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> which is not on it. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">HE</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">HC</span> is common, <div class="perseus-center">the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">HC</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">EH</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">HC</span> respectively;</div> and the base <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span> is equal to the base <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CHG</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">EHC</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop08">I. 8</a>] And they are adjacent angles.</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is called a perpendicular to that on which it stands.

       <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span> has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> from the given point <span class="perseus-emph">C</span> which is not on it.</p>
