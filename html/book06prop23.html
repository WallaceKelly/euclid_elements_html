      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> be equiangular parallelograms having the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span> equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ECG</span>; I say that the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> has to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let them be placed so that <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is in a straight line with <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> is also in a straight line with <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>.</div>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">DG</span> be completed; let a straight line <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> be set out, and let it be contrived that, <div class="perseus-center">as <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">L</span>,</div> and, as <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">L</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">M</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop12">VI. 12</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then the ratios of <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">L</span> and of <span class="perseus-emph">L</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">M</span> are the same as the ratios of the sides, namely of <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span> and of <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the ratio of <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">M</span> is compounded of the ratio of <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">L</span> and of that of <span class="perseus-emph">L</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">M</span>; so that <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> has also to <span class="perseus-emph">M</span> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now since, as <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span>, so is the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] while, as <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CG</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">L</span>, therefore also, as <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">L</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since, as <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>, so is the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop01">VI. 1</a>] while, as <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">CE</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">L</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">M</span>, therefore also, as <span class="perseus-emph">L</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">M</span>, so is the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span> to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop11">V. 11</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since then it was proved that, as <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">L</span>, so is the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span>, and, as <span class="perseus-emph">L</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">M</span>, so is the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CH</span> to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, therefore, <span class="perseus-foreign-la">ex aequali</span>, as <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> is to <span class="perseus-emph">M</span>, so is <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to the parallelogram
       <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">K</span> has to <span class="perseus-emph">M</span> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> also has to <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.</div>
