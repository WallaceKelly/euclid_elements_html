      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> be the given straight line; thus it is required to cut <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the square <span class="perseus-emph">ABDC</span> be described on <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop46">I. 46</a>] let <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> be bisected at the point <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span> be joined; let <span class="perseus-emph">CA</span> be drawn through to <span class="perseus-emph">F</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> be made equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BE</span>; let the square <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span> be described on <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span>, and let <span class="perseus-emph">GH</span> be drawn through to <span class="perseus-emph">K</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> has been cut at <span class="perseus-emph">H</span> so as to make the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BH</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AH</span>.</p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> has been bisected at <span class="perseus-emph">E</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> is added to it, <div class="perseus-center">the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span>.

      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-emph">EF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>.</div></p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> are equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">EB</span>, for the angle at <span class="perseus-emph">A</span> is right; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop47">I. 47</a>] <div class="perseus-center">therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> together with the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-emph">BA</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span>.</div></p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AE</span> be subtracted from each; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> which remains is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>.</div>
       </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">FA</span> is <span class="perseus-emph">FK</span>, for <span class="perseus-emph">AF</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">FG</span>; and the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">FK</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">AD</span>.</div></p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">AK</span> be subtracted from each; <div class="perseus-center">therefore <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span> which remains is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">HD</span>.</div></p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-emph">HD</span> is the rectangle <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BH</span>, for <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>; and <span class="perseus-emph">FH</span> is the square on <span class="perseus-emph">AH</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BH</span> is equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">HA</span>. therefore the given straight line <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> has been cut at <span class="perseus-emph">H</span> so as to make the rectangle contained by <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BH</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-emph">HA</span>.
