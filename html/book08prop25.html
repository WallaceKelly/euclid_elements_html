       <span class="perseus-ital">If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number, and the first be cube, the second will also be cube.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the two numbers <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> have to one another the ratio which the cube number <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has to the cube number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> be cube; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> is also cube. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are cube, <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> are similar solid numbers. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book08prop19">VIII. 19</a>] 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, as many numbers as fall between <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span> in continued proportion, so many will also fall between those which have the same ratio with them; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book08prop08">VIII. 8</a>] so that two mean proportional numbers fall between <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> also. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span> so fall. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Since, then, the four numbers <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> are in continued proportion, and <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is cube, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> is also cube.
