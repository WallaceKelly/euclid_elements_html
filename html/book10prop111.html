      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be an apotome; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is not the same with the binomial straight line. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if possible, let it be so; let a rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> be set out, and to <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> let there be applied the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span> equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> and producing <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> as breadth. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Then, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is an apotome, <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is a first apotome. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop97">X. 97</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> be the annex to it; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> set out. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def03">X. Deff. III. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is binomial, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> is a first binomial straight line. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop60">X. 60</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let it be divided into its terms at <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> be the greater term; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is greater than the square on <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span>, and the greater term <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">DC</span> set out. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def02">X. Deff. II. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop12">X. 12</a>] therefore the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span> is also commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop15">X. 15</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But <span class="perseus-ital">DF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> is also incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop13">X. 13</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">GF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FE</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> is an apotome. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop73">X. 73</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But it is also rational: which is impossible. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the apotome is not the same with the binomial straight line. Q. E. D.</p>
