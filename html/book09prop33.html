       <span class="perseus-ital">If a number have its half odd, it is even-times odd only.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the number <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> have its half odd; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is even-times odd only. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now that it is even-times odd is manifest; for the half of it, being odd, measures it an even number of times. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def09">VII. Def. 9</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say next that it is also even-times odd only. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is even-times even also, it will be measured by an even number according to an even number; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def08">VII. Def. 8</a>] so that the half of it will also be measured by an even number though it is odd: which is absurd. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is even-times odd only. Q. E. D.</p>
