      <p class="perseus-p">Let the ratio of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be the given ratio in least numbers; thus it is required to find numbers in continued proportion, as many as may be prescribed, and the least that are in the ratio of <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let four be prescribed; let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, and by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> let it make <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; let <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> by multiplying itself make <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; further, let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, and let <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">E</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">K</span>. </p>
