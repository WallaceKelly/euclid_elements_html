      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> be commensurable in length; I say that the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number.

      <p class="perseus-p">Next, as the square on <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>, so let the square on <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> be to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>. </p>

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> has to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> the ratio which the number <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> has to the number <span class="perseus-ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">B</span>.
