      <p class="perseus-p">For let the parallelepipedal solid <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be cut by the plane <span class="perseus-ital">CDEF</span> through the diagonals <span class="perseus-ital">CF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DE</span> of opposite planes; I say that the solid <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> will be bisected by the plane <span class="perseus-ital">CDEF</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">CGF</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">CFB</span>, [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop34">I. 34</a>] and <span class="perseus-ital">ADE</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">DEH</span>, while the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span> is also equal to the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, for they are opposite, and <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">CH</span>, therefore the prism contained by the two triangles <span class="perseus-ital">CGF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">ADE</span> and the three parallelograms <span class="perseus-ital">GE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span> is also equal to the prism contained by the two triangles <span class="perseus-ital">CFB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DEH</span> and the three parallelograms <span class="perseus-ital">CH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">BE</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CE</span>; for they are contained by planes equal both in multitude and in magnitude.

      <p class="perseus-p">Hence the whole solid <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is bisected by the plane <span class="perseus-ital">CDEF</span>. Q. E. D.</p>
