      <p class="perseus-p">Let there be two pyramids of the same height which have the triangular bases <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, and vertices the points <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span>, and let each of them be divided into two pyramids equal to one another and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book12prop03">XII. 3</a>] I say that, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so are all the prisms in the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">ABCG</span> to all the prisms, being equal in multitude, in the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">DEFH</span>, </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">BO</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-ital">OC</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">AL</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">LC</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">LO</span> is parallel to <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, and the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is similar to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">LOC</span>. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> is also similar to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">RVF</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is double of <span class="perseus-ital">CO</span>, and <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> of <span class="perseus-ital">FV</span>, therefore, as <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span> is to <span class="perseus-ital">CO</span>, so is <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span> to <span class="perseus-ital">FV</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And on <span class="perseus-ital">BC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CO</span> are described the similar and similarly situated rectilineal figures <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">LOC</span>, and on <span class="perseus-ital">EF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FV</span> the similar and similarly situated figures <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">RVF</span>; therefore, as the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">LOC</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">RVF</span>; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop22">VI. 22</a>] therefore, alternately, as the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so is the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">LOC</span> to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">RVF</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book05prop16">V. 16</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">LOC</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">RVF</span>, so is the prism in which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">LOC</span> is the base and <span class="perseus-ital">PMN</span> its opposite to the prism in which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">RVF</span> is the base and <span class="perseus-ital">STU</span> its opposite; [Lemma following] therefore also, as the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so is the prism in which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">LOC</span> is the base and <span class="perseus-ital">PMN</span> its opposite to the prism in which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">RVF</span> is the base and <span class="perseus-ital">STU</span> its opposite. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the said prisms are to one another, so is the prism in which the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">KBOL</span> is the base and the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">PM</span> its opposite to the prism in which the parallelogram <span class="perseus-ital">QEVR</span> is the base and the straight line <span class="perseus-ital">ST</span> its opposite.

      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so are the said two prisms to the said two prisms. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And similarly, if the pyramids <span class="perseus-ital">PMNG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">STUH</span> be divided into two prisms and two pyramids, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">PMN</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">STU</span>, so will the two prisms in the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">PMNG</span> be to the two prisms in the pyramid <span class="perseus-ital">STUH</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">PMN</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">STU</span>, so is the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>; for the triangles <span class="perseus-ital">PMN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">STU</span> are equal to the triangles <span class="perseus-ital">LOC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">RVF</span> respectively. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore also, as the base <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>, so are the four prisms to the four prisms. </p>

       <p class="perseus-p">But that, as the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">LOC</span> is to the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">RVF</span>, so is the prism in which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">LOC</span> is the base and <span class="perseus-ital">PMN</span> its opposite to the prism in which the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">RVF</span> is the base and <span class="perseus-ital">STU</span> its opposite, we must prove as follows. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">For in the same figure let perpendiculars be conceived drawn from <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> to the planes <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span>; these are of course equal because, by hypothesis, the pyramids are of equal height. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Now, since the two straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span> and the perpendicular from <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> are cut by the parallel planes <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">PMN</span>, they will be cut in the same ratios. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop17">XI. 17</a>] </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">GC</span> is bisected by the plane <span class="perseus-ital">PMN</span> at <span class="perseus-ital">N</span>; therefore the perpendicular from <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> to the plane <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span> will also be bisected by the plane <span class="perseus-ital">PMN</span>. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">For the same reason the perpendicular from <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> to the plane <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> will also be bisected by the plane <span class="perseus-ital">STU</span>. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">And the perpendiculars from <span class="perseus-ital">G</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">H</span> to the planes <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> are equal; therefore the perpendiculars from the triangles <span class="perseus-ital">PMN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">STU</span> to the planes <span class="perseus-ital">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DEF</span> are also equal. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the prisms in which the triangles <span class="perseus-ital">LOC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">RVF</span> are bases, and <span class="perseus-ital">PMN</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">STU</span> their opposites, are of equal height. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Hence also the parallelepipedal solids described from the said prisms are of equal height and are to one another as their bases; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop32">XI. 32</a>] therefore their halves, namely the said prisms, are to one another as the base <span class="perseus-ital">LOC</span> is to the base <span class="perseus-ital">RVF</span>.
