      <p class="perseus-p"><span class="perseus-ital">If two straight lines cut one another</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">they are in one plane</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">and every triangle is in one plane.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the two straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> cut one another at the point <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> are in one plane, and every triangle is in one plane. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let points <span class="perseus-ital">F</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">G</span> be taken at random on <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, let <span class="perseus-ital">CB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span> be joined, and let <span class="perseus-ital">FH</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GK</span> be drawn across; I say first that the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ECB</span> is in one plane. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, if part of the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ECB</span>, either <span class="perseus-ital">FHC</span> or <span class="perseus-ital">GBK</span>, is in the plane of reference, and the rest in another, a part also of one of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> will be in the plane of reference, and a part in another. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if the part <span class="perseus-ital">FCBG</span> of the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ECB</span> be in the plane of reference, and the rest in another, a part also of both the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> will be in the plane of reference and a part in another: which was proved absurd. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop01">XI. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ECB</span> is in one plane. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, in whatever plane the triangle <span class="perseus-ital">ECB</span> is, in that plane also is each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span>, and, in whatever plane each of the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">EC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">EB</span> is, in that plane are <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> also. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book11prop01">XI. 1</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the straight lines <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">CD</span> are in one plane, and every triangle is in one plane. Q. E. D.</p>
