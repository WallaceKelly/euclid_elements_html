       <p class="perseus-p">In parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another, and the diameter bisects the areas.</p>

      <div class="perseus-proof" org="uniform" sample="complete">
       <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-emph">ACDB</span> be a parallelogrammic area, and <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> its diameter; I say that the opposite sides and angles of the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">ACDB</span> are equal to one another, and the diameter <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> bisects it. </p>
       <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, and the straight line <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> has fallen  upon them, <div class="perseus-center">the alternate angles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span> are equal to one another. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop29">I. 29</a>]</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is parallel to <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>has fallen upon them, <div class="perseus-center">the alternate angles <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CBD</span> are equal to one another. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop29">I. 29</a>]</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">DCB</span> are two triangles having the two angles <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BCA</span> equal to the two angles <span class="perseus-emph">DCB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CBD</span> respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely that adjoining the equal angles and common to both of them, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span>; <div class="perseus-center">therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop26">I. 26</a>] therefore the side <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> to <span class="perseus-emph">BD</span>,</div> and further the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDB</span>.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">And, since the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span>, <div class="perseus-center">and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CBD</span> to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACB</span>, the whole angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABD</span> is equal to the whole angle <span class="perseus-emph">ACD</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01cn02">C.N. 2</a>]</div>
        And the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BAC</span> was also proved equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">CDB</span>.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Therefore in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">I say, next, that the diameter also bisects the areas.</p>
       <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span> is equal to <span class="perseus-emph">CD</span>, and <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> is common, the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">AB</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="perseus-emph">DC</span>, <span class="perseus-emph">CB</span> respectively; <div class="perseus-center">and the angle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="perseus-emph">BCD</span>; therefore the base <span class="perseus-emph">AC</span> is also equal to <span class="perseus-emph">DB</span>, and the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">ABC</span> is equal to the triangle <span class="perseus-emph">DCB</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book01prop04">I. 4</a>]</div></p>
       <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the diameter <span class="perseus-emph">BC</span> bisects the parallelogram <span class="perseus-emph">ACDB</span>.</p>
