       <span class="perseus-ital">If an odd number by multiplying an even number make some number, the product will be even.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the odd number <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying the even number <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> make <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>; I say that <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is even. 
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> has made <span class="perseus-ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is made up of as many numbers equal to <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> as there are units in <span class="perseus-ital">A</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book07def15">VII. Def. 15</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And <span class="perseus-ital">B</span> is even; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is made up of even numbers. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">But, if as many even numbers as we please be added together, the whole is even. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book09prop21">IX. 21</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore <span class="perseus-ital">C</span> is even. Q. E. D.</p>
