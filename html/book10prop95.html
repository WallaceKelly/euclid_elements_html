       <span class="perseus-ital">If an area be contained by a rational straight line and a fifth apotome, the “side”
 of the area is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let the area <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> be contained by the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> and the fifth apotome <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>; I say that the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For let <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> be the annex to <span class="perseus-ital">AD</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">GD</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only,  the annex <span class="perseus-ital">GD</span> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span> set out, and the square on the whole <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is greater than the square on the annex <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span>. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10def03">X. Deff. III. 5</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore, if there be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> and deficient by a square figure, it will divide it into incommensurable parts. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop18">X. 18</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let then <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> be bisected at the point <span class="perseus-ital">E</span>, let there be applied to <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> a parallelogram equal to the square on <span class="perseus-ital">EG</span> and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AF</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">FG</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now, since <span class="perseus-ital">AG</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">CA</span>, and both are rational, therefore <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span> is medial. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop21">X. 21</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">DG</span> is rational and commensurable in length with <span class="perseus-ital">AC</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is rational. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop19">X. 19</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Now let the square <span class="perseus-ital">LM</span> be constructed equal to <span class="perseus-ital">AI</span>, and let the square <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> equal to <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span> and about the same angle, the angle <span class="perseus-ital">LPM</span>, be subtracted; therefore the squares <span class="perseus-ital">LM</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">NO</span> are about the same diameter. [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book06prop26">VI. 26</a>] </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Let <span class="perseus-ital">PR</span> be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Similarly then we can prove that <span class="perseus-ital">LN</span> is the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">I say that <span class="perseus-ital">LN</span> is the straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">For, since <span class="perseus-ital">AK</span> was proved medial and is equal to the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">LP</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">PN</span>, therefore the sum of the squares on <span class="perseus-ital">LP</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">PN</span> is medial. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Again, since <span class="perseus-ital">DK</span> is rational and is equal to twice the rectangle <span class="perseus-ital">LP</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">PN</span>, the latter is itself also rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">And, since <span class="perseus-ital">AI</span> is incommensurable with <span class="perseus-ital">FK</span>, therefore the square on <span class="perseus-ital">LP</span> is also incommensurable with the square on <span class="perseus-ital">PN</span>; therefore <span class="perseus-ital">LP</span>, <span class="perseus-ital">PN</span> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial but twice the rectangle contained by them rational. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the remainder <span class="perseus-ital">LN</span> is the irrational straight line called that which produces with a rational area a medial whole; [<a class="perseus-ref" href="book10prop77">X. 77</a>] and it is the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span>. </p>
      <p class="perseus-p">Therefore the “side”
 of the area <span class="perseus-ital">AB</span> is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. Q. E. D.</p>
